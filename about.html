    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>
        Once per day, the headlines from the frontpage of multiple online media outlets
        are scraped, and sent to machine learning models.
        The results are displayed in this website, so that anyone can explore them.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website is an attempt to automate classifying biased and sensationalist
        reporting.
        Similar websites such as <a href="https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/ratings">
        AllSides</a> and <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center/">Media
        Bias/Fact Check</a> are powerful resources, but their classifications
        are done by humans, and as such don't scale well or are slow to react to
        editorial changes.
        Furthermore, they might be subject to human bias (although both the examples
        above have taken extensive measures to avoid that!).
    </p>
    <h1>Why is this important?</h1>
    <p>
        Comparing toxicity in headlines between different media outlets is important
        for several reasons. Firstly, toxic headlines can perpetuate negative
        stereotypes and fuel prejudice against certain groups of people. By comparing
        the level of toxicity in headlines across different newspapers, we can identify
        patterns and trends in the media's portrayal of certain groups and hold them
        accountable for perpetuating harmful narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly, toxic headlines can have a significant impact on people's mental
        health and well-being. Constant exposure to negative news and toxic headlines
        can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and even depression.
        To make matters worse, media outlets are encouraged to provide negative news
        due to humans' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89FoKRtpAy4">negativity
        bias</a>.
        By comparing the level of toxicity in headlines across different newspapers, we
        can identify which newspapers are potentially causing harm to their readers and
        push for more responsible reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, comparing toxicity in headlines can also shed light on the biases and
        agendas of different newspapers. Some newspapers may have a political or
        ideological leaning that affects their reporting (see <a
            href="https://www.allsides.com/media-bias">the work of AllSides</a>), while
        others may prioritize
        sensationalism and clicks over accuracy and ethics. By comparing toxicity in
        headlines, we can gain a better understanding of the motives behind different
        newspapers' reporting and make more informed decisions about which sources to
        trust.
    </p>
    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p>
        Each website in <a href="">our list</a> is fetched once per day (at around 12pm
        UTC), and all the headlines in the frontpage are saved.
        The headlines then go through our machine learning models, which will output a
        score between 0 and 1 for each headline.
        In the <a href="/daily.html">daily page</a>, the average of these scores are
        displayed.
        Then the average of the numbers shown in the daily page are displayed in the <a
            href="/index.html">main page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently the only model running is <a
            href="https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify">Unitary's Detoxify model</a>,
        which was trained on <a
            href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-multilingual-toxic-comment-classification/data">online
        comments</a>.
        Such comments are usually very different from headlines of media articles, so
        these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt.
        Further models are planned to be included in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        To collect the list of media outlets, we started by looking at the most popular
        US online media.
        Some popular examples were skipped for now due to being harder to parse the
        website, but are planned to be included in the future.
        Other countries and languages are also planned for the future.

    <ul>
        <li>adding more media outlets</li>
        <li>adding more interesting models</li>
        <li>improving the UI to get more interesting insights</li>
