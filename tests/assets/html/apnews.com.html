Proponents of tougher penalties say this crisis is different and that, in most places, the stiffer sentences are intended to punish drug dealers, not just users.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There is no other drug — no other illicit drug — that has the same type of effects on our communities,” said Mark Jackson, the district attorney for Douglas County, Nevada, and president of the Nevada District Attorneys Association, which is pushing for stricter penalties for fentanyl-related crimes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the strategy is alarming recovery advocates who say focusing on the criminal angle of drugs has historically backfired, including when lawmakers elevated crack cocaine penalties in the 1980s.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Every time we treat drugs as a law enforcement problem and push stricter laws, we find that we punish people in ways that destroy their lives and make it harder for them to recover later on,” said Adam Wandt, an assistant professor of public policy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. He said people behind bars often continue getting drugs — often without receiving quality addiction treatment — then emerge to find it's harder to get work.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Card:643951047327\" content-id=\"98a97e53a984e8f5a265ed229199ecb1\" class=\"hub-peek-embed\">Hub peek embed (apf-trendingnews) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)\u003c/div>\u003cp>Since 2020, drug overdoses are now linked to more than 100,000 deaths a year nationally, with about two-thirds of them fentanyl-related. That’s more than 10 times as many drug deaths as in 1988, at the height of the crack epidemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fentanyl mostly \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-fentanyl-epidemic-overdoses-26f735a54ee0ba075c394ce85aef03d0\">arrives in the U.S. from Mexico\u003c/a> and is mixed into supplies of other drugs, including cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and counterfeit oxycodone pills. Some users seek it out. Others don't know they're taking it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ingesting 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be fatal, meaning 1 gram — about the same as a paper clip — could contain 500 lethal doses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That's what's driving some lawmakers to crack down with harsh penalties, along with adopting measures such as legalizing \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fentanyl-deaths-keep-rising-states-look-for-solutions-d3ccd6edfdc6516b3ea07943c7e46544\">materials to test drug supplies\u003c/a> for fentanyl and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/naloxone-narcan-overdose-availability-ec12f62eef12ebc67de77afdbb6f11b9\">distributing naloxone\u003c/a>, a drug that can reverse overdoses.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Before this year's legislative sessions began, a dozen states had already adopted fentanyl possession measures, according to tracking by the National Conference of State Legislatures.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"7d12750354af4852a1ac186138dbc20c\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>And in this year, in one legislative chamber of liberal Oregon and one chamber of conservative \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/felony-fentanyl-opioids-west-virginia-penalties-legislature-8c2c0a7f17f1e4d7e11fbaab1476dd2c\">West Virginia\u003c/a>, lawmakers have agreed upon tougher penalties. In her State of the State speech this March, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, called on lawmakers to adopt a drug trafficking bill that includes tougher fentanyl sentences.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Nevada, where Democrats control the Legislature, a bill backed by Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford would give one to 20 years in prison for selling, possessing, manufacturing or transporting 4 grams or more of fentanyl into the state, depending on the amount. It’s a change for Ford, who has supported criminal justice reforms including a sweeping 2019 law that, among other provisions, raised the threshold for such penalties to 100 grams. It would also remove fentanyl from the state’s “Good Samaritan” law, which exempts people from criminal drug possession charges while reporting an overdose.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“What we’ve learned is that lowering the thresholds for all drugs was overinclusive,” Ford said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Harm reduction advocates are pushing Ford and others to rethink their support, arguing the thresholds for longer penalties can sweep up low-level users — not just the dealers the law is aimed at — as well as some who may not even know they are taking fentanyl. They warn that the state’s crime labs test only for the presence of fentanyl, not the exact amount in a mixture of drugs. Thus, people with over 4 grams of drugs containing a few milligrams of fentanyl could be subject to trafficking penalties, they say.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Rosa Johnson runs a needle exchange where she meets people who could face consequences should the stricter fentanyl bill pass. For the dozens of people that show up each day, it is rare for them to cite fentanyl as their “drug of choice.” But it’s also rare that fentanyl test strips come back negative, with the drug being “laced in a lot of things,” Johnson said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Other lawmakers introduced two bills to create penalties for fentanyl with lower thresholds, though much of the internal debate surrounds the Ford-backed bill. Meanwhile, Nevada's Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, a former sheriff, has vowed to introduce tougher legislation that would make possession of any amount of fentanyl the same felony threshold as fentanyl trafficking.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Both Republican-led chambers in South Carolina have passed fentanyl trafficking measures with bipartisan support, although lawmakers haven’t agreed on which version to send the governor. Senators also unanimously approved a bill allowing alleged drug dealers to be charged with homicide in overdose deaths. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford slammed colleagues for selling a “false bill of goods.” While Republican Rep. Doug Gilliam said he understood concerns about ambiguity, he said lawmakers had to send a “strong message” to drug dealers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A Senate subcommittee heard emotional testimony from family members of people who died of a fentanyl overdose. Among them was Holly Alsobrooks, co-founder of an advocacy group that also supports more fentanyl test strips, opioid antidotes and rehabilitation centers. While Alsobrooks said there is no “perfect” solution, she said the fentanyl trafficking measures are the “best” answers she has heard.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are fully behind this bill,” she said. “And if people go to jail, they’re going to go to jail.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Marc Burrows, who leads a Greenville-based harm reduction program that reports it has reversed 700 overdoses through the provision of opioid antidotes, said these bills could increase deaths by creating hesitancy among drug users to report overdoses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just don’t know if a policy like this is the way to do it,” Burrows said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pollard reported from Columbia, South Carolina, and Mulvihill from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

In fact, a prominent organizer of rallies that preceded the Capitol riot posted on Twitter that he intended to remain on the sidelines.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ali Alexander, who as an organizer of the “Stop the Steal” movement staged rallies to promote \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-michael-pence-electoral-college-elections-health-2d9bd47a8bd3561682ac46c6b3873a10\">Trump’s baseless claims\u003c/a> that Democrats stole \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-wins-white-house-ap-fd58df73aa677acb74fce2a69adb71f9\">the 2020 election\u003c/a> from him, warned Trump supporters that they would be \"jailed or worse” if they protested in New York City.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“You have no liberty or rights there,” he tweeted.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One of Alexander’s allies in the “Stop the Steal” campaign was \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-shootings-business-connecticut-alex-jones-c6d0563dc17e7bfa83a881b44e7b9eec\">conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u003c/a>, who amplified the election fraud claims on his Infowars show. Alexander posted that he had spoken to Jones and said that neither of them would be protesting this time around.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’ve both got enough going on fighting the government,” Alexander wrote. “No billionaire is covering our bills.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>That stands in contrast to the days before the Capitol riot when Trump stoked up supporters when he invited them to Washington for a “big protest” on a Jan. 6, tweeting, “Be there, will be wild!” Thousands of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/congress-confirm-joe-biden-78104aea082995bbd7412a6e6cd13818\">Trump supporters stormed the Capitol\u003c/a> that day, busting through windows and violently clashing with officers in an ultimately failed effort to stop the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Since then, about 1,000 participants have been arrested, many racking up steep legal bills and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-rioters-prison-95bdc863812cab48be3d98ada67bd582\">expressing regret and contrition\u003c/a> in court for their actions. Some have complained of feeling abandoned by Trump. And conspiracy theories that the riot was fueled or even set up by undercover law enforcement informants in the crowd have continued to flourish online, with Trump supporters citing that angst as a basis for steering clear of a new large-scale protest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“How many Feds/Fed assets are in place to turn protest against the political arrest of Pres Trump into violence?” tweeted Rep. Marjorie-Taylor Greene. The Georgia Republican also invoked a conspiracy theory that an FBI informant had instigated the Jan. 6 riot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Has Ray Epps booked his flight to NY yet?” she tweeted on Sunday.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Epps, an Arizona man, was filmed encouraging others to enter the Capitol. Conspiracy theorists believe Epps was an FBI informant because he was removed from a Jan. 6 “wanted” list without being charged. In January, the House committee that investigated the Capitol attack said the claims about Epps were “unsupported.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab who has tracked the “Stop the Steal” movement online, said anxiety over being entrapped by so-called agent provocateurs feeds a “paranoia that if they go and do violence, they may get caught and there may be consequences.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It seems to reduce a lot of people's willingness to make big statements about being willing to go out” and engage in violence, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A grand jury is investigating \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-stormy-daniels-michael-cohen-indictment-new-york-f3ce87a1b4ec50fbeaefcbe21f87ab0b\">hush money payments\u003c/a> to women who alleged sexual encounters with Trump. Prosecutors have not said when their work might conclude or when charges could come. House Republicans on Monday wrote to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg seeking documents related to his inquiry, which they called “an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The conflicted feelings over how far to support Trump in his fight against prosecution extends into the political realm, including among fellow Republicans seen as likely opponents in the 2024 race.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His own vice president, Mike Pence, who's expected to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination, castigated Trump in an ABC News interview this weekend as “reckless” for his actions on Jan. 6 and said history would hold him accountable — even as he echoed the former president's rhetoric that an indictment would be a “politically charged prosecution.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have no doubt that President Trump knows how to take care of himself. And he will. But that doesn’t make it right to have a politically charged prosecution of a former president of the United States of America,” Pence said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an expected GOP presidential candidate, criticized the Trump investigation on Monday as politically motivated but also threw one of his first jabs at the former president in a move likely to intensify their simmering political rivalry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some kind of alleged affair. I can’t speak to that,” DeSantis said at a news conference in Panama City. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But, he added, \"what I can speak to is that if you have a prosecutor who is ignoring crimes happening every single day in his jurisdiction and he chooses to go back many, many years ago to try to use something about porn star hush money payments, that’s an example of pursuing a political agenda and weaponizing the office.

Local law enforcement officials are bracing for the public safety ramifications of an unprecedented prosecution of a former American president. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In an internal email following Trump’s statements, Bragg said law enforcement would ensure that the 1,600 people who work in his office would remain safe, and that “any specific or credible threats” would be investigated.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"d3179708238b4771b4eb194c3ed8a875\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“We do not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York,” he wrote, and added: “In the meantime, as with all of our investigations, we will continue to apply the law evenly and fairly, and speak publicly only when appropriate.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>There has been no public announcement of any time frame for the grand jury’s secret work in the case. At least one additional witness is expected to testify, further indicating that no vote to indict has yet been taken, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to publicly discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That did not stop Trump from taking to his social media platform to say “illegal leaks” from Bragg's office indicate that “THE FAR &amp; AWAY LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE &amp; FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WILL BE ARRESTED ON TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>A Trump lawyer, Susan Necheles, said Trump's post was “based on the media reports,\" and a spokesperson said there had been “no notification” from Bragg's office, though the origin of Trump's Tuesday reference was unclear. The district attorney’s office declined to comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump's aides and legal team have been preparing for the possibility of an indictment. Should that happen, he would be arrested only if he refused to surrender. Trump’s lawyers have previously said he would follow normal procedure, meaning he would likely agree to surrender at a New York Police Department precinct or directly to Bragg’s office.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It is unclear whether Trump’s supporters would heed his protest call or if he retains the same persuasive power he held as president. Trump’s posts on Truth Social generally receive far less attention than he used to get on Twitter, but he maintains a deeply loyal base. The aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot, in which hundreds of Trump loyalists were arrested and prosecuted in federal court, may also have dampened the passion among supporters for confrontation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The indictment of Trump, 76, would be an extraordinary development after years of investigations into his business, political and personal dealings. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Even as Trump pursues his latest White House campaign — his first rally is set for Waco, Texas, later this month and he shook hands and took selfies with fans during a public appearance Saturday evening at the NCAA Division I wrestling championships in Tulsa, Oklahoma — there is no question an indictment would be a distraction and give fodder to opponents and critics tired of the legal scandals that have long enveloped him.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Besides the hush money inquiry in New York, Trump faces separate criminal investigations in Atlanta and Washington over his efforts to undo the results of the 2020 election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A Justice Department special counsel has also been presenting evidence before a grand jury investigating Trump’s possession of hundreds of classified documents at his Florida estate. It is not clear when those investigations will end or whether they might result in criminal charges, but they will continue regardless of what happens in New York, underscoring the ongoing gravity – and broad geographic scope – of the legal challenges facing the former president.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump's post Saturday echoes one made last summer when he broke the news on Truth Social that the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-government-and-politics-9e8d683afe87389407950af7ccfdbdd6\">FBI was searching his Florida home\u003c/a> as part of an investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents.\u003c/p>\u003cp>News of that search sparked a flood of contributions to Trump’s political operation, and on Saturday, Trump sent out a series of fundraising emails to his supporters, including one that claimed, “I’m not worried in the slightest.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>After his post, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy decried any plans to prosecute Trump as an “outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA” whom he claimed was pursuing “political vengeance.” Rep. Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, issued a statement with a similar sentiment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The grand jury has been hearing from witnesses, including \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-grand-jury-hush-money-stormy-daniels-fb5c515d90c607d8e954431e271f9e16\">former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u003c/a>, who says he orchestrated payments in 2016 to two women to silence them about sexual encounters they said they had with Trump a decade earlier. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Trump denies the encounters occurred, says he did nothing wrong and has cast the investigation as a “witch hunt” by a Democratic prosecutor bent on sabotaging the Republican’s 2024 campaign.

It has shrunk from supplying Russia’s military — a move that could worsen relations with Washington and turn important European trade partners against Beijing.

In her State of the State speech this March, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, called on lawmakers to adopt a drug trafficking bill that includes tougher fentanyl sentences.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Nevada, where Democrats control the Legislature, a bill backed by Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford would give one to 20 years in prison for selling, possessing, manufacturing or transporting 4 grams or more of fentanyl into the state, depending on the amount. It’s a change for Ford, who has supported criminal justice reforms including a sweeping 2019 law that, among other provisions, raised the threshold for such penalties to 100 grams. It would also remove fentanyl from the state’s “Good Samaritan” law, which exempts people from criminal drug possession charges while reporting an overdose.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“What we’ve learned is that lowering the thresholds for all drugs was overinclusive,” Ford said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Harm reduction advocates are pushing Ford and others to rethink their support, arguing the thresholds for longer penalties can sweep up low-level users — not just the dealers the law is aimed at — as well as some who may not even know they are taking fentanyl. They warn that the state’s crime labs test only for the presence of fentanyl, not the exact amount in a mixture of drugs. Thus, people with over 4 grams of drugs containing a few milligrams of fentanyl could be subject to trafficking penalties, they say.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Rosa Johnson runs a needle exchange where she meets people who could face consequences should the stricter fentanyl bill pass. For the dozens of people that show up each day, it is rare for them to cite fentanyl as their “drug of choice.” But it’s also rare that fentanyl test strips come back negative, with the drug being “laced in a lot of things,” Johnson said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Other lawmakers introduced two bills to create penalties for fentanyl with lower thresholds, though much of the internal debate surrounds the Ford-backed bill. Meanwhile, Nevada's Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, a former sheriff, has vowed to introduce tougher legislation that would make possession of any amount of fentanyl the same felony threshold as fentanyl trafficking.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Both Republican-led chambers in South Carolina have passed fentanyl trafficking measures with bipartisan support, although lawmakers haven’t agreed on which version to send the governor. Senators also unanimously approved a bill allowing alleged drug dealers to be charged with homicide in overdose deaths. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford slammed colleagues for selling a “false bill of goods.” While Republican Rep. Doug Gilliam said he understood concerns about ambiguity, he said lawmakers had to send a “strong message” to drug dealers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A Senate subcommittee heard emotional testimony from family members of people who died of a fentanyl overdose. Among them was Holly Alsobrooks, co-founder of an advocacy group that also supports more fentanyl test strips, opioid antidotes and rehabilitation centers. While Alsobrooks said there is no “perfect” solution, she said the fentanyl trafficking measures are the “best” answers she has heard.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are fully behind this bill,” she said. “And if people go to jail, they’re going to go to jail.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Marc Burrows, who leads a Greenville-based harm reduction program that reports it has reversed 700 overdoses through the provision of opioid antidotes, said these bills could increase deaths by creating hesitancy among drug users to report overdoses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just don’t know if a policy like this is the way to do it,” Burrows said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pollard reported from Columbia, South Carolina, and Mulvihill from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

Positioned high up on the craggy, wind-whipped continental divide in central Colorado, the mountain is relatively well-positioned to endure a warmer, shorter winter season. High altitude, which keeps temperatures cooler and lengthens the time snow stays on the ground, is its golden ticket. But it isn’t immune to extreme weather: it has experienced close calls with wildfires and subsequent mudslides, which washed out a parking lot adjacent to its slopes in 2021.\u003c/p>\u003cp>About a decade ago, the ski area transitioned from spending thousands of dollars annually to cancel out some carbon emissions by paying for carbon credits to instead funding a staff position focused on reducing on-site emissions.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“If we are gonna ask our guests to be better, we’re gonna ask our guests to talk to their leadership, we’re gonna go talk to our leadership directly, we definitely feel like we need to be doing it too,” said Sustainability Manager Mike Nathan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One way they're working to nudge a transition to renewable energies is with newly installed electric vehicle chargers. After a day on the slopes, Denver resident Kurt Zanca returned to his Tesla, which had been charging for free at one of the five dual-port stations situated in the front row of the mountain's parking lot. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Zanca said he thinks charging infrastructure at ski areas can help encourage hesitant shoppers to purchase an EV. “If you can drive up here, charge, go back, no problem, it makes it a lot easier,” Zanca said. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>In the northern French Alps, luxury chalet operator Alikats also sees incentives for customers as a catalyst for change. They offer discounts to guests who travel by train, opt out of eating meat or don't use a hot tub during their stay. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Al Judge, who owns and operates the business with his wife Kat, considers himself a realist. He’s not trying to save snowfall—massive reductions in greenhouse gases emissions worldwide are needed to slow global warming—but rather set a standard for how businesses should operate in a way that respects natural resources and protects biodiversity.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The more that becomes a cultural imperative, the quicker change will happen, and I think business has a very important role to play in that process,” Judge said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Arapahoe Basin, affectionately known by locals as “A-bay,” is working toward net-zero emissions by 2025, partially by relying on credits through the Colorado Carbon Fund to offset some natural gas and diesel they'll still be burning at that time. They also aim to divert 75% of their waste by then — they're currently at 50% through various recycling and composting programs. Nathan says these efforts give them clout when trying to flex their influence off the mountain.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>They've pressured their utility, Xcel Energy, to expedite the transition to renewable power. Earlier this year, Nathan and other industry leaders met with the governor's staff to encourage the rapid transition to manufacturing EV heavy machinery statewide. And, after watching a federal bill that eventually became the Inflation Reduction Act stall, Nathan and Chief Operating Officer Alan Henceroth co-authored an \u003ca href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2021/12/10/colorado-climate-change-ski-industry-opinion/\">op-ed\u003c/a> and sent letters to Colorado’s congressional delegation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Kicking the can for another legislative session was going to have direct and negative impacts on businesses like us,” Nathan said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Similarly active in policy work, Judge runs an \u003ca href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.montagnevertemorzine.com%2Fen%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7CBPeterson%40ap.org%7Cfdc19778b8924731d7ae08db09fbc42d%7Ce442e1abfd6b4ba3abf3b020eb50df37%7C1%7C0%7C638114749160499718%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=lyHq5xPpgYFBEOyRHJugR7thOc3%2FKIJgF74kPnPblew%3D&amp;reserved=0\">organization\u003c/a> that's studying the lack of public transit in the region and expects to soon lobby French officials for a solution. A train route through the northern Alps would provide a more direct public transit option that could reduce the number of flights coming in, Judge said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Customer travel remains a primary source of pollution for ski areas, with air travel, in particular private jets, a major culprit. For example, over 80 percent of flights in and out of Aspen-Pitkin County Airport are private jets, airport officials said. Ideally, airports could tax private jets and invest that money in renewable energy projects, said Schendler. But the Federal Aviation Administration remains a roadblock. Federal law prohibits airports from spending tax revenue offsite. This restricts any renewable projects to airport grounds, and any revenue made from them must be used exclusively at the facility.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While Aspen has yet to win over the FAA, it found a way to sway its local utility, Holy Cross, which supplies power to more than a dozen towns in addition to Vail Mountain Resort along the Interstate-70 corridor. About 15 years ago, Schendler began phoning environmentally minded locals and encouraged them to run for board positions for the utility, which produced about 10% renewable electricity at the time. Today, the board is stacked with pro-renewable members, largely the fruit of lobbying by Aspen and other activists. The utility is split about 50/50 between renewables and fossil fuels, and is committed to 100% renewables by 2030. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Another way to speed the transition to renewables is through power purchase agreements. This is when a business or utility commits to buying a set amount of energy from yet-to-be-built projects, guaranteeing some of the funding to be built.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Vail Resorts, which owns 37 ski areas in three countries, has done this with a wind farm in Nebraska, and is one of five partners for a new solar array in Salt Lake City. Power purchase agreements have helped Vail reach 100% renewable electricity for all its resort and ski areas in North America, and 96% internationally.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Snowshoe Mountain is a ski resort in West Virginia still largely powered by fossil fuels. As the climate bill stalled last summer in Congress, CEO Patti Duncan felt the need to get involved. She doesn't consider herself an activist but wanted to speak up when she watched one of her state’s senators, Joe Manchin, defend the state’s coal industry and hold up the legislation. Duncan wondered, what about the thriving outdoor industry, which is negatively impacted by the burning of fossil fuels?\u003c/p>\u003cp>With encouragement by owner Alterra Mountain Company and climate activist group Protect Our Winters, she wrote a letter to Manchin. Days later, he came out in support of the bill. Duncan said she doesn’t know whether her letter played a role in the senator’s decision but is glad she spoke up.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s my responsibility to do something about it for our resort and our community and our state,” Duncan said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On the other side of the country, Aspen had installed a kiosk at its Limelight Hotel lobby at the base of Snowmass Mountain. The kiosk allowed guests to send a pre-paid card to the senator, encouraging him to support the bill.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The climate bill passed and was signed into law. As a result, record federal funding is now available for households and businesses to decarbonize buildings and transportation. But Mario Molina, executive director of Protect Our Winters, says the work is just getting started.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The next steps are “anything and everything that resorts can engage in to leverage not only their political power but also their power as large consumers to help implement and realize the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act,” Molina said. He cautioned of local opposition to renewable energy projects, and said resorts could make a big impact advocating for the permitting necessary for those projects, in addition to taking advantage of every available credit on their own. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Many skiers applaud such efforts and want their favorite ski areas to have a role in fighting climate change — with an important caveat.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“As long as they’re being sincere and not just sort of doing it for show and not actually making much of a change,” said Archie Bolgar, a British student on vacation at Aspen in January with friends from Boston’s Bentley University.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While there are many environmental issues corporations could embrace, Schendler says the focus must be on reducing emissions to make sure global temperatures don't rise more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to preindustrial times. The rise is currently about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit), and climate scientists warn that as it increases so too will extreme weather events.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If we can stabilize warming at sub 2 degrees Celsius, we’re going to prevent billions of people from suffering. That’s profound,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>(This story has corrected the Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion in the next-to-last paragraph to show that a 2-degree Celsius rise is equal to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, not 2.7.)\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

At least one additional witness is expected to testify, further indicating that no vote to indict has yet been taken, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to publicly discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That did not stop Trump from taking to his social media platform to say “illegal leaks” from Bragg's office indicate that “THE FAR &amp; AWAY LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE &amp; FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WILL BE ARRESTED ON TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>A Trump lawyer, Susan Necheles, said Trump's post was “based on the media reports,\" and a spokesperson said there had been “no notification” from Bragg's office, though the origin of Trump's Tuesday reference was unclear. The district attorney’s office declined to comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump's aides and legal team have been preparing for the possibility of an indictment. Should that happen, he would be arrested only if he refused to surrender. Trump’s lawyers have previously said he would follow normal procedure, meaning he would likely agree to surrender at a New York Police Department precinct or directly to Bragg’s office.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It is unclear whether Trump’s supporters would heed his protest call or if he retains the same persuasive power he held as president. Trump’s posts on Truth Social generally receive far less attention than he used to get on Twitter, but he maintains a deeply loyal base. The aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot, in which hundreds of Trump loyalists were arrested and prosecuted in federal court, may also have dampened the passion among supporters for confrontation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The indictment of Trump, 76, would be an extraordinary development after years of investigations into his business, political and personal dealings. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Even as Trump pursues his latest White House campaign — his first rally is set for Waco, Texas, later this month and he shook hands and took selfies with fans during a public appearance Saturday evening at the NCAA Division I wrestling championships in Tulsa, Oklahoma — there is no question an indictment would be a distraction and give fodder to opponents and critics tired of the legal scandals that have long enveloped him.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Besides the hush money inquiry in New York, Trump faces separate criminal investigations in Atlanta and Washington over his efforts to undo the results of the 2020 election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A Justice Department special counsel has also been presenting evidence before a grand jury investigating Trump’s possession of hundreds of classified documents at his Florida estate. It is not clear when those investigations will end or whether they might result in criminal charges, but they will continue regardless of what happens in New York, underscoring the ongoing gravity – and broad geographic scope – of the legal challenges facing the former president.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump's post Saturday echoes one made last summer when he broke the news on Truth Social that the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-government-and-politics-9e8d683afe87389407950af7ccfdbdd6\">FBI was searching his Florida home\u003c/a> as part of an investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents.\u003c/p>\u003cp>News of that search sparked a flood of contributions to Trump’s political operation, and on Saturday, Trump sent out a series of fundraising emails to his supporters, including one that claimed, “I’m not worried in the slightest.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>After his post, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy decried any plans to prosecute Trump as an “outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA” whom he claimed was pursuing “political vengeance.” Rep. Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, issued a statement with a similar sentiment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The grand jury has been hearing from witnesses, including \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-grand-jury-hush-money-stormy-daniels-fb5c515d90c607d8e954431e271f9e16\">former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u003c/a>, who says he orchestrated payments in 2016 to two women to silence them about sexual encounters they said they had with Trump a decade earlier. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Trump denies the encounters occurred, says he did nothing wrong and has cast the investigation as a “witch hunt” by a Democratic prosecutor bent on sabotaging the Republican’s 2024 campaign. Trump also has labeled Bragg, who is Black, a “racist” and has accused the prosecutor of letting crime in the city run amok while he has focused on Trump. New York remains one of the safest cities in the country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bragg’s office has apparently been examining whether any state laws were broken in connection with the payments or the way Trump’s company compensated Cohen for his work to keep the women’s allegations quiet. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-cohen-stormy-daniels-grand-jury-d48153fc2d3fe7a656e8a24ad1acd082\">Porn actor Stormy Daniels\u003c/a> and at least two former Trump aides — onetime political adviser Kellyanne Conway and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-hope-hicks-stormy-daniels-investigation-2208626cae24cca9e95b8ebe5a7f7213\">former spokesperson Hope Hicks\u003c/a> — are among witnesses who have met with prosecutors in recent weeks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Cohen has said that at Trump’s direction, he arranged payments totaling $280,000 to Daniels and Playboy model \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-america-donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-lawsuits-d8f22980841e44939399ae7179a4d583\">Karen McDougal\u003c/a>. According to Cohen, the payouts were to buy their silence about Trump, who was then in the thick of his first presidential campaign. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Cohen and federal prosecutors said Trump's company paid him $420,000 as reimbursement for the $130,000 payment to Daniels and to cover bonuses and other supposed expenses. The company classified those payments internally as legal expenses. The $150,000 payment to McDougal was made by the then-publisher of the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer, which kept her story from coming to light.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute the Enquirer’s corporate parent in exchange for its cooperation in a campaign finance investigation that led to charges against Cohen in 2018. Prosecutors said the payments to Daniels and McDougal amounted to impermissible, unrecorded gifts to Trump’s election effort.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cohen pleaded guilty, served prison time and was disbarred. Federal prosecutors never charged Trump with any crime.\u003c/p>\u003cp>News that law enforcement agencies were preparing for a possible indictment was first reported by NBC News.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tucker reported from Washington.

Last fall, he headlined a gala for Susan B.

Trump said such moves are “a sign of disloyalty” in an interview with David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network. And he accused anti-abortion leaders of failing to do enough to help GOP candidates in the midterms, which hasn't sat well with some evangelicals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bob Vander Plaats, the president of Iowa's Family Leader, said that abortion remains “a character-defining issue” that helps voters determine whether they can trust candidates or not. \u003c/p>\u003cp>So far, he said, it's unclear whether evangelicals can trust Trump in 2024. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“While we’re thrilled that he gave us justices to overturn Roe v. Wade, and we’re thrilled he did other things on abortion, frankly I think there's a big question mark out there,” Vander Plaats said. “Where is he on the sanctity of life? Does he really believe what he says he believes? When he’s pivoting and when he doesn’t want to talk about it and when he throws the pro-life community under the bus, those are all indicators that give us more cause for pause.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump's campaign pushed back against such concerns.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung listed Trump's “unmatched” record on abortion, highlighting Trump's Supreme Court nominations, his moves to block taxpayer-funded abortion and his decision to reinstate the “Mexico City” policy that required nongovernmental organizations as a condition of funding not to promote abortion as a family planning method in other countries. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“There has been no bigger advocate for the movement than President Trump,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in New York and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee, Florida, contributed to this report.\u003c/p>","sponsored":false,"contentBundle":null,"localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"3d0ae9b8e03e4c9ab9646ac475cdcad9","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>FILE - Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC 2023, March 4, 2023, at National Harbor in Oxon Hill, Md.

It comes as Beijing and Moscow have intensified ties in steps that began shortly before Russia's invasion of Ukraine with a meeting between the two leaders in Beijing during last year's Winter Olympics at which they declared a “no limits” partnership. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Since then, China has repeatedly sided with Russia in blocking international action against Moscow for the Ukraine conflict and, U.S. officials say, is considering supplying Russia with weapons to support the war. But it has also tried to cast itself in a more neutral role, offering a peace plan that was essentially ignored.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The meeting in Moscow is likely to see the two sides recommit to their partnership, which both see as critical to countering what they consider undue and undeserved influence exerted by the U.S. and its Western allies. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ICC ARREST WARRANT ISSUED FOR PUTIN? \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>In the immediate term, the ICC's warrant for Putin and one of his aides is unlikely to have a major impact on the meeting or China's position toward Russia. Neither China nor Russia — nor the United States or Ukraine — has ratified the ICC's founding treaty. The U.S., beginning with the Clinton administration, has refused to join the court, fearing that its broad mandate could result in the prosecution of American troops or officials.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That means that none of the four countries formally recognizes the court's jurisdiction or is bound by its orders, although Ukraine has consented to allowing some ICC probes of crimes on its territory and the U.S. has cooperated with ICC investigations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In addition, it is highly unlikely that Putin would travel to a country that would be bound by obligations to the ICC. If he did, it is questionable whether that country would actually arrest him. There is precedent for those previously indicted, notably former Sudanese President Omar Bashir, to have visited ICC members without being detained.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>However, the stain of the arrest warrant could well work against China and Russia in the court of public opinion and Putin's international status may take a hit unless the charges are withdrawn or he is acquitted. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE VIEW FROM WASHINGTON?\u003c/p>\u003cp>U.S. officials have not minced words when it comes to Xi's planned visit to Moscow. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby called Beijing’s push for an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine a “ratification of Russian conquest” and warned that Russians could use a cease-fire to regroup their positions “so that they can restart attacks on Ukraine at a time of their choosing.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We do not believe that this is a step towards a just, durable peace,” he said. Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan this week called on Xi to also speak with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian leader has also expressed interest in talks with Xi.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE VIEW FROM KYIV?\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Speaking before the ICC warrant was unveiled, Ukrainian analysts cautioned against falling into a potential trap ahead of the Xi-Putin meeting. “We need to be aware that such peace talks are a trap for Ukraine and its diplomatic corps,” said Yurii Poita, who heads the Asia section at the Kyiv-based New Geopolitics Research Network. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Under such conditions, these peace talks won’t be directed toward peace,” said Nataliia Butyrska, a Ukrainian analyst on politics related to Eastern Asia. She said the visit reflects not so much China's desire for peace but its desire to play a major role in whatever post-conflict settlement may be reached. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“China does not clearly distinguish between who is the aggressor and who is the victim. And when a country begins its peacekeeping activities or at least seeks to help the parties, not distinguishing this will affect objectivity,” Butyrska said. “From my perspective, China seeks to freeze the conflict.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE VIEW FROM MOSCOW?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even if China stops short of providing military assistance to Russia as the U.S. and its allies fear, Moscow sees Xi's visit as a powerful signal of Chinese backing that challenges Western efforts to isolate Russia and deal crippling blows to its economy. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kremlin spokesman Yuri Ushakov noted that Putin and Xi have “very special friendly and trusting personal ties” and hailed Beijing’s peace plan. “We highly appreciate the restrained, well-balanced position of the Chinese leadership on this issue,” Ushakov said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Observers say that despite China’s posturing as a mediator, its refusal to condemn the Russian action leaves no doubt about where Beijing’s sympathy lies. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The Chinese peace plan is a fig leaf to push back against some Western criticism on support for Russia,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The optics that it creates is that China has a peace plan, both parties of war endorsed it and were ready to explore the opportunities and then it was killed by the hostile West.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS THE VIEW FROM BEIJING?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chinese officials have been boasting about their new-found clout in the international arena as their country's foreign policy has become increasingly assertive under Xi. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In announcing the Xi visit, China's foreign ministry said Beijing's ties with Moscow are a significant world force. “As the world enters a new period of turbulence and change, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and an important power, the significance and influence of China-Russia relations go far beyond the bilateral scope,” it said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It called the visit “a journey of friendship, further deepening mutual trust and understanding between China and Russia, and consolidating the political foundation and public opinion foundation of friendship between the two peoples for generations.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Washington and Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv

Here's a look at the favorites, underdogs and long shots.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHO’S FAVORED TO REACH THE FINAL FOUR?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Earlier this week, top-seeded Houston was the plus-135 favorite to emerge as the Midwest Region representative and play in Houston, according to \u003ca href=\"https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/ncaab?tab=march-madness\">FanDuel Sportsbook\u003c/a>. That means a $100 bet pays $135. The next top team in the region is No. 5 Texas at plus-350.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Alabama, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/march-madness-2023-e8fe1bfd7964f938781458952670f51a\">the No. 1 overall seed\u003c/a>, was plus-150 to come out of the South. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The most competitive region appears to be the West. Top seed Kansas opened as a slight favorite but later shared that spot with 2-seed UCLA at plus-330 (before the Jayhawks were ousted). No. 3 seed Gonzaga wasn't far behind at plus-400.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Top seed Purdue was at plus-300 to come out of the East, but the Boilermakers lost in the first round.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>WHO’S FAVORED TO WIN THE TITLE?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>After a batch of upsets, the favorites heading into the Sweet 16 are (in order, as of March 19): Alabama, Houston, UConn, UCLA, Gonzaga and Texas, according to \u003ca href=\"https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/ncaab?tab=national-champion\">FanDuel Sportsbook.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHO IS THE BIGGEST UNDERDOG?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>If you were looking for the next Saint Peter's or Loyola-Chicago, check out these options.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nineteen teams were listed at plus-50,000: Arizona State, Charleston, Colgate, Furman, Grand Canyon, Howard, Iona, Kennesaw State, Kent State, Louisiana-Lafayette, Montana State, Nevada, Northern Kentucky, Oral Roberts, Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi, Texas Southern, UC Santa Barbara, UNC Asheville and Vermont. Furman did advance to the second round with a big win over 4th-seeded Virginia but that was it. Princeton, anyone?\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHAT’S THE BIGGEST SPREAD DIFFERENCE? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>Alabama was a 23 1/2-point favorite over Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi. Kansas was favored by 22 1/2-over Howard in their first-round matchup — the same spread \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/march-madness-fairleigh-dickinson-purdue-16-seed-715e3e361344928ea10880dd9a9d8a58\">Fairleigh Dickinson faced against Purdue before its shocking 63-58 win.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHAT’S THE BIGGEST OVER/UNDER?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>The old saying is that life is too short to bet the under, but it's often the wise play. Some of these totals may give bettors second thoughts before taking the over, but that doesn't mean it's the wrong move. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The highest totals heading into the tourney were Gonzaga-Grand Canyon, Missouri-Utah State and Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi-Southeast Missouri State at 155 1/2 each, Xavier-Kennesaw State at 153 1/2, Auburn-Iowa at 151 1/2 and Florida Atlantic-Memphis and Colgate-Texas at 150 1/2 each.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>NOT REAL UNDERDOGS\u003c/h2>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Just because the committee seeds one team over another doesn't necessarily mean it's the better team in the minds of the oddsmakers. Games where the lower seed was the favorite on the early line: Tenth-seeded Utah State by 1 1/2 points over seventh-seeded Missouri (Missouri won), ninth-seeded West Virginia by 2 1/2 over eighth-seeded Maryland (Maryland won) and ninth-seeded Auburn by 1 1/2 over eighth-seeded Iowa (Auburn won 83-75).\u003c/p>\u003cp>PROPS\u003c/p>\u003cp>Circa Sports in Las Vegas likes the chances of the 5-12 opening-round upset trend continuing, posting the odds of a No. 12 seed winning at minus-510. Odds also are in the favor of a No. 13 beating a four-seed at minus-250. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A victory by a No. 14 (plus-110), No. 15 (plus-195) and No. 16 (plus-745) aren't as likely but that's March Madness: A 15 and a 16 won in the first round, after all. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Big 12 had the highest total for number of tournament wins by a conference at 11.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>BRACKETS\u003c/h2>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/march-madness-brackets-ncaa-arizona-virginia-princeton-furman-e05e2095ceedec75d99c5c5ae0c037fe\">The chase for the perfect bracket in office pools and everywhere else ended before the second round\u003c/a> this year. Wins by the likes of 15-seed Princeton, 13-seed Furman and 16-seed Fairleigh Dickinson's near-historic win over No. 1 seed Purdue left the number of perfect brackets at 0 late Friday in the major

We welcome China's willingness to play a constructive role in resolving the crisis.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>China in February released a position paper calling for an end to fighting in Ukraine and for upholding all countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity. It did not address how to resolve Russia's illegal claim to have annexed four regions of Ukraine. \u003c/p>\u003cp>White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told “Fox News Sunday” that any call for a cease-fire in Ukraine coming out of the Putin-Xi meeting would be unacceptable to the U.S. because it would only “ratify Russian’s conquest to date,” and give Moscow “time to refit, retrain, re-man and try to plan for a renewed offensive.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Putin arrived in Mariupol by helicopter and then drove himself around the city’s “memorial sites,” concert hall and coastline, Russian news reports said.

Valery Gerasimov, who is in charge of the Russian military operations in Ukraine. Peskov said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Peskov said the trip had been unannounced, and that Putin intended to “inspect the work of the (command) post in its ordinary mode of operation.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Speaking to the state RIA-Novosti agency, Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin made clear that Russia was in Mariupol to stay. He said the government hoped to finish the reconstruction of its blasted downtown by the end of the year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“People have started to return.

Many were trapped without food, water, heat or electricity.

U.N. investigators also said there was evidence for the forced transfer of “hundreds” of Ukrainian children to Russia.

It will also test the power of personal persuasion in the clubby Senate, whose members can often be influenced by fellow members whose counsel they trust. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In this case, both New Hampshire Democratic senators, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, strongly back Delaney and are deeply respected by other senators. Both are also fierce supporters of abortion rights. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At issue is a New Hampshire law, passed in 2003 but repealed in 2007, that required minors to tell their parents before they obtained an abortion. As the state’s deputy attorney general, Delaney was among those who signed a brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court that defended the law because it “does not present a substantial obstacle to any woman's right to choose an abortion.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The law, according to the brief filed in the case, Ayotte vs. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, \"promotes compelling state interests, not the least of which is protecting the health of the pregnant minor by providing an opportunity for parents to supply essential medical history information to the physician.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Delaney's involvement is detailed in response to written questions from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that he submitted after his confirmation hearing last month. But his signature on the brief has caused consternation for Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a strong supporter of abortion rights.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“For me personally, reproductive rights is a fundamental, core issue,\" Blumenthal told The Associated Press. \"And I think I’d want to know why he put his name on the brief and what it reflects in his personal view.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Besides Blumenthal, two other Democratic members of the closely divided Senate, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, have also expressed general reservations about his nomination, particularly as it relates to the St. Paul's case. And at least one other Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee is concerned about Delaney’s involvement in the Planned Parenthood case, according to a person familiar with the senator’s thinking who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing deliberations over the nomination.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One factor being weighed is how much Delaney's involvement in the brief was just a matter of course in his job. Delaney told senators that he was not involved in the decision to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, nor did he represent New Hampshire during oral arguments there. He was not directly involved in formulating the brief's arguments, he said, and while he read the brief before it was submitted, he said he does not recall whether he offered substantive feedback. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>In a statement to the AP, former New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, said: “Mike Delaney strongly supports women’s reproductive freedom.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lynch said he disagreed with then-Attorney General Kelly Ayotte on the Planned Parenthood case. “When Mike became my legal counsel, he worked with me to successfully repeal the law at issue in the case,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, in private conversations, groups that support abortion access have similarly raised questions about why Delaney signed a brief that defended abortion restrictions. They have been dissatisfied with the responses. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In a previously unreported letter, the National Council of Jewish Women said it would oppose the confirmation of Delaney, the first nominee from the Biden administration that it has rejected. The group pointed to his representation of St. Paul’s as well as to his signature on the Planned Parenthood brief.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Saying federal judges should have a record that “evidences fairness, independence, fidelity to constitutional values, and respect for the individuals who appear before the court seeking justice,” the group wrote in the letter that ”unfortunately, after reviewing the record, we do not think that Mr. Delaney possesses those important qualifications.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The White House continues to support Delaney's nomination. Privately, White House officials are concerned that focusing on one motion or case could set a precedent for Republican opponents of Biden's picks to undermine other candidates for the bench, according to a person with knowledge of the internal deliberations who insisted on anonymity to discuss them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This was the first we had heard that anyone was interested in more information beyond his 116 pages of thorough, under-oath answers,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. \"Michael Delaney has three decades of legal experience, including his service as Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General of New Hampshire, and he is well-qualified to serve in this important position. The White House expects Senators to take his full record into account when evaluating his nomination.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a potent political force in Democratic politics, was noncommittal on Delaney's nomination, saying in a statement: “Planned Parenthood conducts a review of the records of federal judicial nominees. Our review of this nominee and his involvement in the Ayotte case is ongoing.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden nominated Delaney for the appeals court in January, almost a year after Shaheen's office first contacted him to discuss filling the vacancy. Since then, Shaheen and Hassan have been Delaney's biggest patrons, despite a rocky confirmation hearing that even Democrats say did not go well for him after he faced repeated questions from Republican senators who attacked his handling of the St. Paul's case. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Shaheen and Hassan have worked privately to lobby colleagues. In a closed-door lunch with other Democratic senators earlier this month, Shaheen and Hassan made their case while offering what attendees described as more context and history on his involvement in the St. Paul’s case. During that meeting, the two senators also distributed copies of an endorsement letter from Susan Carbon, a longtime state judge in New Hampshire who served as director of the Office on Violence Against Women during the Obama administration.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He has the experience, the intellect, the character and commitment to justice, and a broad, broad amount of support, including from advocates for victims,” Hassan said. Delaney has been rated well qualified by the American Bar Association, and Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., says he will support him. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, concerns persist among a handful of Democrats. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Booker said he had some “preliminary concerns” about how Delaney handled the sexual assault case. Hirono said she was prepared to support him after his confirmation hearing but said she was now reviewing his written testimony and added: “So we shall see.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Blumenthal added: “Having concerns doesn’t necessarily mean that any of us will oppose his nomination.” Still, most Democrats on the committee said they were undecided on whether to confirm him.\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false,"tagIds":["JoeBiden","apf-politics","apf-topnews","apf-usnews","apf-Health","NewHampshire","OnlyonAP","NewHampshirestategovernment"],"tagObjs":[{"id":"JoeBiden","name":"Joe

It's asking, ‘Who created this? Why? Why am I seeing it now? How does it make me feel and why?’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>New laws and algorithm changes are often offered as the most promising ways of combating online misinformation, even as tech companies study their own solutions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Teaching internet literacy, however, may be the most effective method. New Jersey, Illinois and Texas are among states that have recently implemented new standards for teaching internet literacy, a broad category that can include lessons about how the internet and social media work, along with a focus on how to spot misinformation by cross-checking multiple sources and staying wary of claims with missing context or highly emotional headlines.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Media literacy lessons are often included in history, government or other social studies classes, and typically offered at the high school level, though experts say it's never too early — or late — to help people become better users of the internet. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Finnish children begin to learn about the internet in preschool, part of a robust anti-misinformation program that aims to make the country's residents more resistant to false online claims. Finland has a long history of combating propaganda and misinformation spread by one of its neighbors, Russia, and expanded its current efforts after Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea set off another wave of disinformation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Media literacy was one of our priorities before the time of the internet,” Petri Honkonen, Finland's minister of science and culture, said in a recent interview. “The point is critical thinking, and that is a skill that everybody needs more and more. We have to somehow protect people. We also must protect democracy.\"\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Honkonen spoke with The Associated Press earlier this year during a trip to Washington that included meetings to discuss Finland's work to fight online misinformation. One recent report on media literacy efforts in western democracies placed Finland at the top. Canada ranked seventh, while the U.S. came in at No. 18.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Finland the lessons don't end with primary school. Public service announcements offer tips on avoiding false online claims and checking multiple sources. Additional programs are geared toward older adults, who can be especially vulnerable to misinformation compared to younger users more at home on the internet.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the U.S., attempts to teach internet literacy have run into political opposition from people who equate it to thought control. Lee, the Seattle teacher, said that concern prevents some teachers from even trying.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Several years ago, the University of Washington launched MisinfoDay, which brought high schoolers and their teachers together for a one-day event featuring speakers, exercises and activities focused on media literacy. Seven hundred students from across the state attended one of three MisinfoDays this year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jevin West, the University of Washington professor who created the event, said he's heard from educators in other states and as far away as Australia who are interested in creating something similar.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Maybe eventually, someday, nationally here in the United States, we have a day devoted to the idea of media literacy,\" West said. “There are all sorts of things we can do in terms of regulations, technology, in terms of research, but nothing is going to be more important than this idea of making us more resilient” to misinformation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For teachers already struggling with other classroom demands, adding media literacy can seem like just one more obligation. But it's a skill that is just as important as computer engineering or software coding for the future economy, according to Erin McNeill, a Massachusetts mother who started Media Literacy Now, a national nonprofit that advocates for digital literacy education.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“This is an innovation issue,” McNeill said. “Basic communication is part of our information economy, and there will be huge implications for our economy if we don't get this right.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The driver's education analogy comes up a lot when talking to media literacy experts. Automobiles first went into production in the early 20th century and soon became popular. But it was nearly three decades before the first driver's education courses were offered.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What changed? Governments passed laws regulating vehicle safety and driver behavior. Auto companies added features like collapsible steering columns, seat belts and air bags. And in the mid-1930s, safety advocates began to push for mandated driver's education.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That combination of government, industry and educators is seen as a model by many misinformation and media literacy researchers. Any effective solution to the challenges posed by online misinformation, they say, must by necessity include an educational component.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Media literacy in Canadian schools began decades ago and initially focused on television before being expanded throughout the digital era. Now it's accepted as an essential part of preparing students, according to Matthew Johnson, director of education at MediaSmarts, an organization that leads media literacy programs in Canada.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We need speed limits, we need well-designed roads and good regulations to ensure cars are safe. But we also teach people how to drive safely,\" he said. \"Whatever regulators do, whatever online platforms do, content always winds up in front of an audience, and they need to have the tools to engage critically with it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Klepper reported from

It made me feel if I were in their shoes, I’d be doing exactly what they were doing.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>That's not the case when protestors in recent years began attacking Fauci for mask mandates, school closures, quarantines and bizarre claims about the COVID-19 vaccines.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s one sign that says, ‘Fauci, You’re Killing Us’ and the other sign that says ‘Fauci, You’re Killing Us’ but the rationale for those from the 1980s to 2023 is enormously different,” Fauci said. “They couldn't be more different.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In one remarkable sequence in the documentary, Mannucci presses Fauci on whether he might have handled things differently looking back — like asking Americans to adopt masks sooner or ordering quarantines faster. “Maybe I should have done that,” he says. “Yeah, I was wrong.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Mannucci relied on 10 long sit-downs with Fauci to develop trust with his subject and didn't clutter the documentary with testimonials from talking heads, wanting to focus on Fauci's experiences. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I hope it’s not viewed as a partisan message, but as a portrait of who he is and what he went through,” said the director. “I hope that people on the other side, even if they never end up agreeing with him, will at least see somebody who is a real person, who’s a thinking person, who’s somebody maybe they can even relate to.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The film ends with Fauci's retirement from the NIAID late last year.
