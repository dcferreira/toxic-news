Justice Department lawyers in the documents probe have said they have amassed evidence of potential crimes involving Trump's retention of national defense information as well as potential efforts to obstruct their work.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Some legal experts have questioned the wisdom of having the Manhattan case be the first brought against Trump, when more serious charges could be looming. Trump is expected to be charged with falsifying business records, a misdemeanor unless prosecutors can prove it was done to conceal another crime. And the case dates back years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\"Clearly it's not the cleanest criminal case that could be brought of all of them that are existing right now,\" said Michael Weinstein, an attorney and former Justice Department prosecutor, who said Trump would likely use its potential weaknesses to his political advantage.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“By this case coming first, it gives him a opening to go on offense and attack, which for him is the only way he knows,\" Weinstein said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, he said the possible charges felt like a natural culmination of the “unbelievable array of investigations\" the former president \"has lived through and battled for the last 40 years.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There's a history and pattern of him saying and doing things without resulting in any consequences,” Weinstein said. “After 40 years, do the criminal chickens come home to roost? He's been fighting a long time, and it could be in the next 12 months he's facing two or three criminal cases that carry serious criminal liability for him.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>The New York case involves payments made by Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who served prison time after pleading guilty in 2018 to federal charges, to porn actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal. Cohen was reimbursed by Trump, whose company logged the reimbursements as “legal expenses.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Politically, Trump allies believe the case actually will benefit the former president in the short term by energizing his base in a competitive Republican primary, and would provide another boost later on if it ultimately fails to yield a conviction.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The prosecutor in New York has done more to help Donald Trump get elected,” says Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., echoing other GOP officials, who have also argued the probe will likely help Trump in the short term, even if it could prove damaging in a general election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>An indictment wouldn't stop Trump from continuing his campaign. There is no prohibition against running while facing criminal charges — or even following conviction. Indeed, convicted felons have run for president before, including from behind bars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It boggles the mind to think that we have an ex-president on the eve of being indicted still the frontrunner for the Republican Party in 2024,” says presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. “You would have thought (potentially) being arrested would have been a disqualifying factor in presidential politics. But Trump constantly surprises people by his devious and inappropriate behavior that he transcends by turning it into being a victim of a witch hunt.”\u003c/p>","sponsored":false,"contentBundle":null,"localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"ead037ab59f1412ebbc79bc8cf6c2033","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>A police officer places a barricade in front of Trump Tower, on Tuesday, March 21, 2023, in New York.

Trump lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, through a shell company before being reimbursed by Trump, whose company, the Trump Organization, logged the reimbursements as legal expenses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Earlier in 2016, Cohen also arranged for former Playboy model Karen McDougal to be paid $150,000 by the publisher of the supermarket tabloid The National Enquirer, which then squelched her story in a journalistically dubious practice known as “catch-and-kill.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump denies having sex with either woman.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump’s company “grossed up” Cohen’s reimbursement for the Daniels payment to defray tax payments, according to federal prosecutors who filed criminal charges against the lawyer in connection with the payments in 2018. In all, Cohen got $360,000 plus a $60,000 bonus, for a total of $420,000.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"90b8f06293bc4cc7b090aec3b8c81a83\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Cohen pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance law in connection with the payments. Federal prosecutors say the payments amounted to illegal, unreported assistance to Trump’s campaign. But they declined to file charges against Trump himself.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s team appears to be looking at whether Trump or anyone committed crimes in New York state in arranging the payments, or in the way they accounted for them internally at the Trump Organization. \u003c/p>\u003ch2>BUT CAN A FORMER PRESIDENT BE INDICTED?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>In a word, yes. Longstanding Justice Department policy prohibits the federal indictment of a sitting president, but Trump, two years out of office, no longer enjoys that legal shield. And the New York case is not a federal probe anyway.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHAT IS THIS GRAND JURY?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>A grand jury is made up of people drawn from the community, similar to a trial jury. But unlike juries that hear trials, grand juries don’t decide whether someone is guilty or innocent. They only decide whether there is sufficient evidence for someone to be charged. Grand juries exist in the federal court system and in many states. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Proceedings are closed to the public, including the media. There is no judge present nor anyone representing the accused. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Prosecutors call and question witnesses, and grand jurors can also ask questions. In New York, the person who could be indicted may ask for a certain witness, though it's up to grand jurors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>New York grand juries have 23 people. At least 16 must be present to hear evidence or deliberate. Twelve have to agree there is enough evidence in order to issue an indictment. The grand jury may also find there is not enough evidence of a crime or direct the prosecutor to file lesser charges. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Centuries-old rules have kept grand juries under wraps to protect the reputations of people who end up not being charged, to encourage reluctant witnesses to testify, to prevent those about to be indicted from fleeing and to guard against outside pressure. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Grand juries have long been criticized as little more than rubber stamps for prosecutors. Former New York Judge Sol Wachtler famously said that prosecutors could convince a grand jury to “indict a ham sandwich.” Defenders of the process say it is a crucial safeguard against politically motivated prosecutions. \u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHO HAS TESTIFIED IN THIS CASE? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-grand-jury-new-york-costello-7fbb5cfdd0db010cea262d34f60efd5c\">One of the final witnesses being called was Robert Costello,\u003c/a> who was once a legal adviser to Cohen, the government’s key witness in the investigation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The men have since had a falling out, and Costello has indicated that he has information he believes would undercut the credibility of Cohen and contradict his current incriminating statements about Trump.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Costello contacted a lawyer for Trump saying he had information that could be exculpatory for Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss secret legal proceedings. The lawyer brought it to the attention of the district attorney’s office, which last week subpoenaed Costello’s law firm for records and invited him to testify.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>He was at the building where the jurors were meeting on Monday, invited by prosecutors, ensuring the grand jury had an opportunity to consider testimony or evidence that could weaken the case for indicting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-stormy-indictment-jury-new-york-564e1947c822a32c3111f5e1c4146138\">Trump was also been invited to testify,\u003c/a> but his lawyer has said the former president has no plans to participate. \u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHAT ABOUT THE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>Trump says charges would actually help him in the 2024 presidential contest. Longtime ally Lindsey Graham, senator from South Carolina, said Saturday that District Attorney Bragg “has done more to help Donald Trump get elected.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, considering joining the Republican field, criticizes the Trump investigation as politically motivated, “fundamentally wrong.” But he also threw one of his first jabs at the former president in a quip likely to intensify their rivalry. DeSantis said he personally doesn’t “know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some kind of alleged affair.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Comments by other potential rivals, eager to convince voters it is time to move on from the former president but also contending with the fact that he remains the most popular figure in the party:\u003c/p>\u003cp>— During a Saturday visit to Iowa, former Vice President Mike Pence called the idea of indicting a former president “deeply troubling.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>— Asa Hutchinson, the former Arkansas governor mulling his own 2024 bid, said he didn’t expect Trump to withdraw from the race after an indictment, though that would be the “right” thing to do. \u003c/p>\u003cp>— Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a declared candidate who also served as Trump's U.N. ambassador, said Monday on Fox News that Bragg's case was an attempt at scoring “political points,\" adding, “You never want to condone any sort of prosecution that's being politicized.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“At the end of the day, not one single person’s opinion of him will be any different after indictment than it was before,” veteran GOP operative Terry Sullivan said in an interview. “All of his perceived negatives are already baked into his name ID with voters.” \u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHAT ABOUT OTHER TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>The New York probe is among \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-investigations-glance-7feef166c55ada94c670ebe3ae295902\">many legal woes Trump is facing.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Justice Department is investigating his retention of top secret government documents at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving the White House, as well as possible efforts to obstruct that probe. Federal investigators are also still probing the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and efforts to overturn the election Trump falsely claimed was stolen.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Portions of a report from a special grand jury in Georgia \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-election-investigation-grand-jury-documents-40535dd2b4401e804af515229c6c2d68\">that investigated whether Trump and his allies illegally interfered in the 2020 election\u003c/a> in Georgia shows jurors believed “one or more witnesses” committed perjury and urged local prosecutors to bring charges. The former president never testified, but the report didn't foreclose the possibility of other charges. \u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHAT'S NEXT IN NEW YORK? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>It's unclear. Trump declared in a social media post over the weekend that he expects to be taken into custody on Tuesday and urged supporters to protest his possible arrest. However, there has been no public announcement of any time frame for the grand jury’s secret work. A Trump spokesperson said there has been no notification from Bragg's office. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Law enforcement officials have been making security preparations for the possibility of an indictment in coming days or weeks — or a court appearance by the president himself.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WILL TRUMP BE HANDCUFFED?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Anna Cominsky, a New York Law School professor and former criminal defense lawyer, said that her best guess is that Trump’s lawyers will work out a deal with the prosecutor’s office to avoid the spectacle of an indictment with handcuffs and a perp walk.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There is a great likelihood that he will self-surrender, which means you won’t see a 5 a.m. knock on Mar-a-Lago’s door, officers swarming his house and arresting him and bringing him out in handcuffs,” she said. “He would appear at the prosecutor’s office voluntarily and then be processed, fingerprinted and his picture taken. ”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cominsky is less sure that Trump would want to avoid a public appearance for his arraignment, which would come within two days of an indictment. At that time a judge lists the charges and asks if the defendant pleads guilty or not guilt.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He doesn’t shy away from the chaos, so he may want to use this to his advantage,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington, Anthony Izaguirre from Tallahassee, Florida, and Bernard Condon and Michael R.

The policymakers will also try to peer into the future and forecast the likely path of growth, employment, inflation and their own interest rates. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Those forecasts will be released Wednesday, when most economists expect the Fed to announce a relatively modest quarter-point hike in its benchmark rate, its \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/inflation-business-jerome-powell-government-and-politics-875599570f2b3bfc132963010a404f09\">ninth hike since March of last year\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The projections this time will be particularly difficult. In their most recent forecasts in December, Fed officials projected that they would raise their short-term rate to about 5.1%, roughly a half-point above the current level.

The Fed is meeting less than two weeks after Silicon Valley Bank failed in the second-largest bank collapse in American history. That shock was followed by the failure of another major bank, Signature Bank. A third, First Republic Bank, was saved from collapse by \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/first-republic-bank-deposits-rescue-9daaea0e7133007d5e7f8257030d1b1c\">a $30 billion cash infusion\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:386669778972' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='91a9185ebce972bbf5ab1f46654f1a53'>Hub peek embed (Inflation) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) \u003c/div>\u003cp>Given the heightened uncertainties overhanging the financial system, there's a small chance that the Fed \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisRugaber/status/1637914197819367431\">could decide not to issue its usual quarterly projections\u003c/a>. Three years ago, when the pandemic struck, the Fed moved up a scheduled policy meeting to a Sunday, rather than on Tuesday and Wednesday, to urgently address the economic anxieties caused by new pandemic restrictions. After that meeting, the Fed didn’t release any quarterly projections.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the time, Powell said that issuing economic and interest rate forecasts, when the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic were so unclear, “could have been more of an obstacle to clear communication than a help.” Still, the unusual decision then was as much a reflection of the chaos of the early pandemic as it was of the uncertain outlook. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>If the Fed does raise its key rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday, it would reach roughly 4.9%, the highest point in nearly 16 years. Early this month, Powell had said \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/inflation-federal-reserve-interest-rates-powell-unemployment-79b7ead4530ab381a17638a6c9df2d90\">in congressional testimony that a half-point rate increase\u003c/a> would be possible at this week's meeting. The banking crisis has suddenly upended that outlook. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It will be a tough call for the 11 Fed officials who will vote on the rate decision. With \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jobs-unemployment-inflation-economy-federal-reserve-43c8e14bcddae79da2e58a57a902d154\">hiring still strong\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/retail-sales-inflation-economy-consumer-d6c196bd068d441d7c87d70d945e8fdf\">consumers still spending\u003c/a> and inflation still elevated, a rate hike would normally be a straightforward move.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Not this time. The Fed is expected to treat inflation and financial turmoil as two separate problems, to be managed simultaneously by separate tools: Higher rates to address inflation and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/banks-federal-reserve-silicon-valley-lending-fa9cea4bf6a24f881337630acf04ecfd\">greater Fed lending to banks\u003c/a> to calm financial turmoil. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Complicating matters will be the difficulty in determining the impact on the economy of the collapse of Silicon Valley and Signature. The Fed, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and Treasury Department agreed to insure all the deposits at those banks, including those above the $250,000 cap. The Fed also created a new lending program to ensure that banks can access cash to repay depositors, if needed. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>But economists warn that many mid-sized and small banks, in order to conserve capital, will likely become more cautious in their lending. A tightening of bank credit could, in turn, reduce business spending on new software, equipment and buildings. It could also make it harder for consumers to obtain auto or other loans. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some economists worry that such a slowdown in lending could be enough to tip the economy into recession. Wall Street traders are betting that a weaker economy will force the Fed to start cutting rates this summer. Futures markets have priced in three quarter-point cuts by the end of the year. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Fed would likely welcome slower growth, which would help cool inflation. But few economists are sure what the effects would be of a pullback in bank lending. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Most recent data still points to a solid economy and rampant hiring. Employers added a robust 311,000 jobs in February, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jobs-unemployment-inflation-economy-federal-reserve-43c8e14bcddae79da2e58a57a902d154\">the government said earlier this month\u003c/a>. And while the unemployment rate rose, from 3.4% to a still-low 3.6%, that mostly reflected an influx of new job-seekers who were not immediately hired. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Consumer spending was robust in January, fueled in part by a large cost-of-living adjustment for 70 million recipients of Social Security and other benefits.

hear arguments that have become familiar over the past seven years of legal proceedings. Since Paltrow and Sanderson’s skis intertwined on what they expected to be an enjoyable day on the slopes with friends and family, the two have been tangled in a lengthy legal drama about what really happened on a beginner’s run that day at one of the most upscale ski destinations in the United States.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The mountain, Deer Valley Resort, has among the region’s most expensive lift tickets and is known for its après-ski champagne yurts and proximity to Park City — a posh resort town known for hosting the Sundance Film Festival.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Though the court is not publishing a witness list, attorneys said Wendell Gibby and Sam Goldstein — a radiologist and neuropsychologist — would likely be called to testify on Wednesday.

Karlene Davidson said the crash had “changed” Sanderson and contributed to the demise of their romance. Craig Ramon testified that Paltrow hit Sanderson and said that afterward, one of her family's ski instructors came up to him and said “Your buddy just took out Gwyneth Paltrow.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The trial underway in Park City is the latest development in the seven-year case and follows Sanderson's decision to amend an earlier lawsuit after a $3.1 million complaint that named Paltrow and Deer Valley was dismissed.

Many older people weren’t vaccinated, pharmacies lacked antivirals, and hospitals didn’t have adequate supplies or staff — leading to as many as hundreds of thousands of deaths that could have been avoided, according to academic modeling, more than 20 interviews with current and former Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention employees, experts and government advisers, and internal reports and directives obtained by the AP.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“If they had a real plan to exit earlier, so many things could have been avoided,” said Zhang Zuo-Feng, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Many deaths could have been prevented.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>For two years, China stood out for its tough but successful controls against the virus, credited with saving millions of lives as other countries struggled with stop-and-start lockdowns. But with the emergence of the highly infectious omicron variant in late 2021, many of China’s top medical experts and officials worried zero-COVID was unsustainable.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In late 2021, China’s leaders began discussing how to lift restrictions. As early as March 2022, top medical experts submitted detailed proposals to prepare for a gradual exit to the State Council, China’s cabinet.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But discussions were silenced after an outbreak the same month in Shanghai, which prompted Chinese leader Xi Jinping to lock the city down.

The less lethal but far more infectious omicron made curbing COVID-19 harder and the risks of its spread lower, and nearby Korea, Japan and Singapore were all loosening controls.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That winter, the State Council appointed public health experts to a new committee tasked with reviewing COVID-19 controls, which submitted a report in March 2022, four people with knowledge of it said.

It ran over 100 pages long and included detailed proposals to boost China’s stalling vaccination campaign, increase ICU bed capacity, stock up on antivirals, and order patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms to stay at home, one of the people said. It also included a proposal to designate Hainan, a tropical island in the country’s south, as a pilot zone to experiment with relaxing controls.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But then things began going awry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid-business-health-pandemics-hong-kong-61c2a448663e0288508cb46d8a553b24?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=AP\">A chaotic, deadly outbreak in Hong Kong\u003c/a> alarmed Beijing.

Provincial officials argued that they lacked Shanghai’s medical resources and capacity to trace the virus, risking its spread to the entire country before China was ready.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the same time, China’s flagging vaccination rate for older residents and the deaths in Hong Kong spooked authorities, as did reports of long COVID-19 abroad. When Shanghai failed to get control of the virus, the top leadership stepped in. Partial lockdowns in Shanghai were announced in late March. On April 2, then-Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, a top official known widely as the “COVID czar,\" \u003ca href=\"http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqfkdt/202204/2361ebedb61f4113a8a3649bd85bc871.shtml\">traveled there to oversee a total lockdown\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They lost their nerve,” said an expert in regular contact with Chinese health officials.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-china-shanghai-wuhan-ab6e4fd3cfd587a76e32f29b6800378c\">Shanghai was ill-prepared.\u003c/a> Residents exploded in anger online, complaining of hunger and spotty supplies. But Beijing made it clear that the lockdown would continue.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Resolutely uphold zero-COVID,\" an editorial in the state-run People’s Daily said. \u003ca href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/2022-03/24/c_1128498251.htm\">“Persistence is victory,”\u003c/a> said Xi. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003ch2>KEEPING SILENCE\u003c/h2>\u003cp>After Shanghai locked down, Chinese public health experts stopped speaking publicly about preparing for an exit.

Some experts were blacklisted from Chinese media, one told the AP.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Anybody who wanted to say something that is different from the official narrative was basically just silenced,” the blacklisted expert said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In early April, China’s State Council \u003ca href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3173879/chinas-foreign-firms-desperate-shift-away-old-toolbox-mass\">leaked a letter from the European Chamber of Commerce\u003c/a> urging relaxation of zero-COVID controls. Council officials wanted to spark debate but didn’t feel empowered to raise the issue themselves, according to a person directly familiar with the matter.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The State Council’s information office did not respond to a fax requesting comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gao Fu, then head of the China CDC, also hinted at the need to prepare for an exit. At a mid-April internal panel discussion recently made public by the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization think tank, \u003ca href=\"https://ccgupdate.substack.com/p/ccg-in-april-recommended-chinese\">Gao was quoted as saying\u003c/a> “omicron is not that dangerous,\" that there were public discussions on whether zero-COVID needed to be adjusted, and that they “hope to reach a consensus as soon as possible.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Weeks later, at a private event at the German Embassy in Beijing, Gao agreed with foreign experts urging China to plan a reopening and then strode off the stage, according to three attendees who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. Gao did not respond to an email requesting comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There were also hints that opinions differed high in the party.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In private meetings with Western business chambers in May, then-Premier Li Keqiang, who was head of the State Council and the party’s No. 2 official at the time, appeared sympathetic to complaints about how zero-COVID was crushing the economy, according to a participant and another briefed on the meetings. It was a stark contrast with \u003ca href=\"http://nl.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/zgyw/202205/t20220518_10688542.htm\">pre-recorded remarks from Xi\u003c/a> that listed defeating COVID as the top priority.

Those who thought zero-COVID unsustainable — like Gao and Zhang, the Shanghai doctor — fell silent. But Liang Wannian, then head of the central government’s expert working group on COVID-19, kept vocally advocating for zero-COVID as a way to defeat the virus. Though Liang has a doctorate in epidemiology, he is sometimes accused of pushing the party line rather than science-driven policies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He knows what Xi wants to hear,” said Ray Yip, the founding head of the United States CDC office in China.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Liang shot down suggestions for reopening in internal meetings in January and May of 2022, Yip said, making it difficult for others to suggest preparations for an exit. Liang did not respond to an email requesting comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Health authorities also knew that once China reopened, there would be no going back. Some were spooked by unclear data, long COVID and the chance of deadlier strains, leaving them wracked with uncertainty.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Every day, we were flooded with oceans of unverified data,” said a China CDC official. “Every week we heard about new variants. … Yes, we should find a way out of zero-COVID, but when and how?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Authorities may also have been waiting for the virus to weaken further or for \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid-science-technology-health-00e7e5ebf9460bad115b491009b58bef\">new, more effective, Chinese-developed mRNA vaccines.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They didn’t have a sense of urgency,” said Zhu Hongshen, a postdoctoral fellow studying China’s zero-COVID policy at the University of Pennsylvania. “They thought they could optimize the whole process, they thought they had time.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Shanghai lockdown stretched from an expected eight days to two months. By the time Shanghai opened back up, it was just months away from China’s pivotal 20th Party Congress, where Xi was expected to be confirmed for \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/xi-jinping-china-president-vote-5e6230d8c881dc17b11a781e832accd1\">a controversial and precedent-breaking third term.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>Risking an outbreak was off the table. Though scientists from Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan wrote internal petitions urging the government to start preparations, they were told to stay quiet until the congress was over.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Everybody waits for the party congress,” said one medical expert, declining to be named to comment on a sensitive topic. “There’s inevitably a degree of everyone being very cautious.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003ch2>INCREASING PRESSURE\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Officials across China took extraordinary measures to stop omicron from spreading.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-travel-99d16a6da3f4dda26f370be6786041e9\">Tourists were locked into hotels\u003c/a>, traders were huddled into indefinite quarantine and many stopped traveling for fear of being stranded far from home.

Still, officials stuck to their guns, as the government fired those who didn’t keep COVID under control. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Yet omicron kept spreading.

They bused some Beijing residents to distant quarantine centers and asked them not to post online about it, one told the AP. Some village officials deliberately underreported the number of COVID-19 cases to give the sense that the virus was under control.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Local governments poured tens of billions of dollars into mass testing and quarantine facilities. From Wuhan to villages in industrial Hebei province, civil servants were pressed into testing or quarantine duty because local governments ran out of money to hire workers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the Congress in mid-October, top officials differing with Xi were sidelined.

He wrote twice to Xi personally, telling him that zero-COVID was not sustainable and urging a gradual reopening, said a person acquainted with Zhong. Business people in finance, trade, and manufacturing concerned about the tanking economy were also lobbying authorities behind the scenes, a government adviser told the AP.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Along with the lobbying, pressure to reopen came from outbreaks flaring up across the country. A Nov. 5 internal notice issued by Beijing health authorities and obtained by the AP called the virus situation “severe.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In early November, Sun, China’s top “COVID czar,” summoned experts from sectors including health, travel and the economy to discuss adjusting Beijing’s virus policies, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meetings. Zhong, the prominent doctor, presented data from Hong Kong showing omicron’s low fatality rate after the city’s last outbreak, two said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Nov. 10, Xi ordered adjustments.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Adhere to scientific and precise prevention and control,” Xi said, \u003ca href=\"http://www.nhc.gov.cn/wjw/mtbd/202301/53e4bdbadd0f4a3384c0af7e38f16427.shtml\">according to a state media account\u003c/a>, signaling he wanted officials to cut back on extreme measures.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The next day, Beijing announced 20 new measures tweaking restrictions, such as reclassifying risk zones and reducing quarantine times. But at the same time, Xi made clear, China was sticking to zero-COVID.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Necessary epidemic prevention measures cannot be relaxed,” Xi said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003ch2>THE EXIT\u003c/h2>\u003cp>The government wanted order.

Xi called city officials, instructing them to have measures that were neither too strict nor too soft, according to a person familiar with the matter.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Individual apartments were put under sudden lockdowns that lasted hours or days. The sheer number of tests and cases overwhelmed medical workers. Travel, shopping, and dining ground to a halt, streets emptied, and the wealthy bought one-way plane tickets out of China.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In late November, public frustration boiled over. \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/china-fires-6a1b6902e6ccf87e064f1232045a2848\">A deadly apartment fire in China’s far west Xinjiang region\u003c/a> sparked nationwide protests over locked doors and other virus control measures. \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-china-xi-jinping-shanghai-covid-b85c65c576b9326c012a19422ae2dc82\">Some called on Xi to resign\u003c/a>, the most direct challenge to the Communist Party’s power since pro-democracy protests in 1989.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Riot police moved in and the protests were swiftly quelled. But behind the scenes, the mood was shifting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>References to “zero-COVID” vanished from government statements.

Some were struck by how quickly the tone had shifted, with one saying the leadership had become “even more radical” than the experts, according to a retired official.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Dec. 1, Xi told visiting European Council President Charles Michel that the protests were driven by youth frustrated with the lockdowns, according to a person briefed on Xi’s remarks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We listen to our people,” the person recounted Xi telling Michel.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The final decision was made suddenly, and with little direct input from public health experts, several told the AP.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“None of us expected the 180-degree turn,” a government adviser said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many in the Chinese government believe the protests accelerated Xi’s decision to scrap virus controls entirely, according to three current and former state employees.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was the trigger,” said one, not identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Dec. 6, Xi instructed officials to change COVID-19 controls, \u003ca href=\"http://www.nhc.gov.cn/wjw/mtbd/202301/53e4bdbadd0f4a3384c0af7e38f16427.shtml\">Xinhua reported\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The next day, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-business-china-covid-economy-e5559f6062cf052a71ad6ba1ceece693\">Chinese health authorities announced 10 sweeping measures\u003c/a> that effectively scrapped controls, canceling virus test requirements, mandatory centralized quarantine and location-tracking health QR codes. The decision to reopen so suddenly caught the country by surprise.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Even three days’ notice would have been good,” said a former China CDC official. “The way this happened was just unbelievable.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Soon, the sick overran emergency wards and patients sprawled on floors. COVID-19 antivirals sold for thousands of dollars a box on the black market.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In just six weeks, about 80% of the country was infected — more than a billion people, the China CDC later estimated. But even as deaths mounted, authorities ordered state media to deflect criticism over China’s sudden reopening, according to a leaked directive \u003ca

It's asking, ‘Who created this? Why? Why am I seeing it now? How does it make me feel and why?’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>New laws and algorithm changes are often offered as the most promising ways of combating online misinformation, even as tech companies study their own solutions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Teaching internet literacy, however, may be the most effective method. New Jersey, Illinois and Texas are among states that have recently implemented new standards for teaching internet literacy, a broad category that can include lessons about how the internet and social media work, along with a focus on how to spot misinformation by cross-checking multiple sources and staying wary of claims with missing context or highly emotional headlines.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Media literacy lessons are often included in history, government or other social studies classes, and typically offered at the high school level, though experts say it's never too early — or late — to help people become better users of the internet. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Finnish children begin to learn about the internet in preschool, part of a robust anti-misinformation program that aims to make the country's residents more resistant to false online claims. Finland has a long history of combating propaganda and misinformation spread by one of its neighbors, Russia, and expanded its current efforts after Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea set off another wave of disinformation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Media literacy was one of our priorities before the time of the internet,” Petri Honkonen, Finland's minister of science and culture, said in a recent interview. “The point is critical thinking, and that is a skill that everybody needs more and more. We have to somehow protect people. We also must protect democracy.\"\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Honkonen spoke with The Associated Press earlier this year during a trip to Washington that included meetings to discuss Finland's work to fight online misinformation. One recent report on media literacy efforts in western democracies placed Finland at the top. Canada ranked seventh, while the U.S. came in at No. 18.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Finland the lessons don't end with primary school. Public service announcements offer tips on avoiding false online claims and checking multiple sources. Additional programs are geared toward older adults, who can be especially vulnerable to misinformation compared to younger users more at home on the internet.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the U.S., attempts to teach internet literacy have run into political opposition from people who equate it to thought control. Lee, the Seattle teacher, said that concern prevents some teachers from even trying.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Several years ago, the University of Washington launched MisinfoDay, which brought high schoolers and their teachers together for a one-day event featuring speakers, exercises and activities focused on media literacy. Seven hundred students from across the state attended one of three MisinfoDays this year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jevin West, the University of Washington professor who created the event, said he's heard from educators in other states and as far away as Australia who are interested in creating something similar.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Maybe eventually, someday, nationally here in the United States, we have a day devoted to the idea of media literacy,\" West said. “There are all sorts of things we can do in terms of regulations, technology, in terms of research, but nothing is going to be more important than this idea of making us more resilient” to misinformation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For teachers already struggling with other classroom demands, adding media literacy can seem like just one more obligation. But it's a skill that is just as important as computer engineering or software coding for the future economy, according to Erin McNeill, a Massachusetts mother who started Media Literacy Now, a national nonprofit that advocates for digital literacy education.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“This is an innovation issue,” McNeill said. “Basic communication is part of our information economy, and there will be huge implications for our economy if we don't get this right.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The driver's education analogy comes up a lot when talking to media literacy experts. Automobiles first went into production in the early 20th century and soon became popular. But it was nearly three decades before the first driver's education courses were offered.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What changed? Governments passed laws regulating vehicle safety and driver behavior. Auto companies added features like collapsible steering columns, seat belts and air bags. And in the mid-1930s, safety advocates began to push for mandated driver's education.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That combination of government, industry and educators is seen as a model by many misinformation and media literacy researchers. Any effective solution to the challenges posed by online misinformation, they say, must by necessity include an educational component.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Media literacy in Canadian schools began decades ago and initially focused on television before being expanded throughout the digital era. Now it's accepted as an essential part of preparing students, according to Matthew Johnson, director of education at MediaSmarts, an organization that leads media literacy programs in Canada.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We need speed limits, we need well-designed roads and good regulations to ensure cars are safe. But we also teach people how to drive safely,\" he said. \"Whatever regulators do, whatever online platforms do, content always winds up in front of an audience, and they need to have the tools to engage critically with it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Klepper reported from

Positioned high up on the craggy, wind-whipped continental divide in central Colorado, the mountain is relatively well-positioned to endure a warmer, shorter winter season. High altitude, which keeps temperatures cooler and lengthens the time snow stays on the ground, is its golden ticket. But it isn’t immune to extreme weather: it has experienced close calls with wildfires and subsequent mudslides, which washed out a parking lot adjacent to its slopes in 2021.\u003c/p>\u003cp>About a decade ago, the ski area transitioned from spending thousands of dollars annually to cancel out some carbon emissions by paying for carbon credits to instead funding a staff position focused on reducing on-site emissions.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“If we are gonna ask our guests to be better, we’re gonna ask our guests to talk to their leadership, we’re gonna go talk to our leadership directly, we definitely feel like we need to be doing it too,” said Sustainability Manager Mike Nathan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One way they're working to nudge a transition to renewable energies is with newly installed electric vehicle chargers. After a day on the slopes, Denver resident Kurt Zanca returned to his Tesla, which had been charging for free at one of the five dual-port stations situated in the front row of the mountain's parking lot. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Zanca said he thinks charging infrastructure at ski areas can help encourage hesitant shoppers to purchase an EV. “If you can drive up here, charge, go back, no problem, it makes it a lot easier,” Zanca said. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>In the northern French Alps, luxury chalet operator Alikats also sees incentives for customers as a catalyst for change. They offer discounts to guests who travel by train, opt out of eating meat or don't use a hot tub during their stay. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Al Judge, who owns and operates the business with his wife Kat, considers himself a realist. He’s not trying to save snowfall—massive reductions in greenhouse gases emissions worldwide are needed to slow global warming—but rather set a standard for how businesses should operate in a way that respects natural resources and protects biodiversity.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The more that becomes a cultural imperative, the quicker change will happen, and I think business has a very important role to play in that process,” Judge said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Arapahoe Basin, affectionately known by locals as “A-bay,” is working toward net-zero emissions by 2025, partially by relying on credits through the Colorado Carbon Fund to offset some natural gas and diesel they'll still be burning at that time. They also aim to divert 75% of their waste by then — they're currently at 50% through various recycling and composting programs. Nathan says these efforts give them clout when trying to flex their influence off the mountain.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>They've pressured their utility, Xcel Energy, to expedite the transition to renewable power. Earlier this year, Nathan and other industry leaders met with the governor's staff to encourage the rapid transition to manufacturing EV heavy machinery statewide. And, after watching a federal bill that eventually became the Inflation Reduction Act stall, Nathan and Chief Operating Officer Alan Henceroth co-authored an \u003ca href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2021/12/10/colorado-climate-change-ski-industry-opinion/\">op-ed\u003c/a> and sent letters to Colorado’s congressional delegation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Kicking the can for another legislative session was going to have direct and negative impacts on businesses like us,” Nathan said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Similarly active in policy work, Judge runs an \u003ca href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.montagnevertemorzine.com%2Fen%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7CBPeterson%40ap.org%7Cfdc19778b8924731d7ae08db09fbc42d%7Ce442e1abfd6b4ba3abf3b020eb50df37%7C1%7C0%7C638114749160499718%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=lyHq5xPpgYFBEOyRHJugR7thOc3%2FKIJgF74kPnPblew%3D&amp;reserved=0\">organization\u003c/a> that's studying the lack of public transit in the region and expects to soon lobby French officials for a solution. A train route through the northern Alps would provide a more direct public transit option that could reduce the number of flights coming in, Judge said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Customer travel remains a primary source of pollution for ski areas, with air travel, in particular private jets, a major culprit. For example, over 80 percent of flights in and out of Aspen-Pitkin County Airport are private jets, airport officials said. Ideally, airports could tax private jets and invest that money in renewable energy projects, said Schendler. But the Federal Aviation Administration remains a roadblock. Federal law prohibits airports from spending tax revenue offsite. This restricts any renewable projects to airport grounds, and any revenue made from them must be used exclusively at the facility.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While Aspen has yet to win over the FAA, it found a way to sway its local utility, Holy Cross, which supplies power to more than a dozen towns in addition to Vail Mountain Resort along the Interstate-70 corridor. About 15 years ago, Schendler began phoning environmentally minded locals and encouraged them to run for board positions for the utility, which produced about 10% renewable electricity at the time. Today, the board is stacked with pro-renewable members, largely the fruit of lobbying by Aspen and other activists. The utility is split about 50/50 between renewables and fossil fuels, and is committed to 100% renewables by 2030. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Another way to speed the transition to renewables is through power purchase agreements. This is when a business or utility commits to buying a set amount of energy from yet-to-be-built projects, guaranteeing some of the funding to be built.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Vail Resorts, which owns 37 ski areas in three countries, has done this with a wind farm in Nebraska, and is one of five partners for a new solar array in Salt Lake City. Power purchase agreements have helped Vail reach 100% renewable electricity for all its resort and ski areas in North America, and 96% internationally.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Snowshoe Mountain is a ski resort in West Virginia still largely powered by fossil fuels. As the climate bill stalled last summer in Congress, CEO Patti Duncan felt the need to get involved. She doesn't consider herself an activist but wanted to speak up when she watched one of her state’s senators, Joe Manchin, defend the state’s coal industry and hold up the legislation. Duncan wondered, what about the thriving outdoor industry, which is negatively impacted by the burning of fossil fuels?\u003c/p>\u003cp>With encouragement by owner Alterra Mountain Company and climate activist group Protect Our Winters, she wrote a letter to Manchin. Days later, he came out in support of the bill. Duncan said she doesn’t know whether her letter played a role in the senator’s decision but is glad she spoke up.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s my responsibility to do something about it for our resort and our community and our state,” Duncan said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On the other side of the country, Aspen had installed a kiosk at its Limelight Hotel lobby at the base of Snowmass Mountain. The kiosk allowed guests to send a pre-paid card to the senator, encouraging him to support the bill.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The climate bill passed and was signed into law. As a result, record federal funding is now available for households and businesses to decarbonize buildings and transportation. But Mario Molina, executive director of Protect Our Winters, says the work is just getting started.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The next steps are “anything and everything that resorts can engage in to leverage not only their political power but also their power as large consumers to help implement and realize the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act,” Molina said. He cautioned of local opposition to renewable energy projects, and said resorts could make a big impact advocating for the permitting necessary for those projects, in addition to taking advantage of every available credit on their own. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Many skiers applaud such efforts and want their favorite ski areas to have a role in fighting climate change — with an important caveat.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“As long as they’re being sincere and not just sort of doing it for show and not actually making much of a change,” said Archie Bolgar, a British student on vacation at Aspen in January with friends from Boston’s Bentley University.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While there are many environmental issues corporations could embrace, Schendler says the focus must be on reducing emissions to make sure global temperatures don't rise more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to preindustrial times. The rise is currently about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit), and climate scientists warn that as it increases so too will extreme weather events.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If we can stabilize warming at sub 2 degrees Celsius, we’re going to prevent billions of people from suffering. That’s profound,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>(This story has corrected the Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion in the next-to-last paragraph to show that a 2-degree Celsius rise is equal to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, not 2.7.)\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Guard \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MarchMadnessMBB/status/1637189182576533508?s=20\">Santiago Vescovi\u003c/a> is the smallest starter at 6-3 and 191 pounds as Tennessee fills the court up to big man Uros Plavsic at 7-1 and 265 pounds. \u003c/p>\u003cp>FAU has its own 7-1 post player in Vladislav Goldin from Russia, but he spots Plavsic 25 pounds. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Asked Monday if he had gotten a call from Tennessee coach Josh Heupel yet about joining the football team, Plavsic had a quick answer after finishing with more fouls (four) than rebounds (three) or points (zero) against Duke. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Surprisingly not,” Plavsic said. \"I was waiting for one, but maybe he wants to see some more.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Yet Tennessee finished with fewer fouls (11) than Duke (17) for all of the Vols' punishing play. Barnes said it was just teams playing hard. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m on the rules committee, and the referees did what they thought was right,\" Barnes said. \"And I thought they officiated the game the way they felt it went. But from my perspective, I didn’t see anything dirty from either team.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tennessee averages 16.5 fouls per game, putting the Vols in the middle of the SEC where Arkansas, another Sweet 16-bound team, is tied for the league high in averaging 19.3 fouls a game. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For the record, FAU (33-3) averages 15.7 fouls a game. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Barnes defended his Volunteers for working and playing hard. He wants them \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MarchMadnessMBB/status/1637171299561930752?s=20\">running fast up the court\u003c/a> and bulling their way through screens to score.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On defense, Barnes doesn't want them giving up shots. Defending well also means blocking out for the rebound on missed shots. That literally means physically leaning and pushing an opponent for the best position to grab the ball. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Does that translate to playing a burly, bullying style? Barnes sure doesn't want his Vols helping opponents parade to the free throw line. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“But we are an older, stronger team, big guys. so you’d have to define physicality in terms of how do we use it ...,” Barnes said. \"We’re going to try to play as hard as we can play. If that’s being physical, I guess we’re going to be physical.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Call it mucking up a beautiful game or dragging an opponent down into the mud. That's exactly where these experienced Vols feel most comfortable. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Tennessee allowed an average of 53.5 points through its first two NCAA Tournament games. The Vols lead the nation holding opponents to 26.4% shooting from 3-point range and are third in the country in both scoring defense (57.8 points) and field-goal defense (37.2%) allowed per game.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Only five teams have even reached 70 points against Tennessee. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our physicality and our toughness is something that bring people down to the mud,” Plavsic said. \"And once you get in there, it’s not easy to get out of it. And I really think that we are looking forward and trying to put all those things to bring going down to the mud and see how they can handle it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP coverage of March Madness: \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness\">https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket\">https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\">https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\u003c/a>\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[{"id":"afs:Reporter:863371156381","fullName":"Teresa M.

Forgotten after eight straight sellouts to end the regular season. Chants of “Eff K-U” during home games, the epitome of a long-standing inferiority complex toward their bitter rival, replaced by pride-filled shouts of “K-S-U,” much to the relief of a coach who demands 10 pushups every time his players swear.\u003c/p>\u003cp>This is a coach who can be found posted up on a purple sofa delivered to random spots around campus, from dining halls to the engineering building, so that he can chat with students going about their everyday lives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I mean, I'm just happy to see Coach Tang and our team having so much success,” says \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/march-madness-kentucky-kansas-state-e0f322d3422ce45e56ec92d210ea55d8\">Markquis Nowell, their All-American guard.\u003c/a> “He's the reason we play with so much love and joy. And you know, we still have a lot to prove.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tang kept using the term “elevate” when he was hired to replace Bruce Weber a year ago. But not even the longtime Baylor assistant could imagine how quickly, and how high, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/AP_Top25/status/1637614896367140864?s=20\">he would have the Wildcats soaring.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“We surpassed the epectations I had,” Tang said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press. “But like, you don't enjoy this, you shouldn't be doing it, right? Our guys, our young people, our community deserves to have someone that really appreciates them and desires to be around them. They deserve this.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The first thing to understand about Tang's winding road to the heartland of America is fortunate to be here. Not here, as in Kansas State. Here, as in alive.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Born in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago, Tang moved to St. Croix with his mother and three siblings while his father chased work in the oil industry. He was about 5 years old and playing marbles beneath a car in his aunt's driveway when his cousin, not knowing he was there, got behind the wheel and drove away.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Drove right over him,” remembers Tang's older sister, Kim. “He's lucky. He was in the hospital for weeks.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Perhaps that brush with death somehow infused in Tang his profoundly deep faith — “I believe my gift is ministry,” he explains, “and my passion just happens to be basketball.\" Or perhaps it somehow led to a preternaturally optimistic outlook on life, which has served him well as he tries to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/march-madness-sports-manhattan-mens-college-basketball-texas-8d2a90d1813be03b4a5a9d91f69c28f0\">resurrect Kansas State's basketball program\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He treats people the right way,” says Baylor coach Scott Drew, his longtime friend. “He just always sees the good in people.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tang grew up playing cricket and soccer, and when his family moved to the Houston area, it became baseball and football — this was Texas, after all. But in 1979, while watching Magic Johnson and Michigan State beat Larry Bird and Indiana State in the title game that truly gave birth to March Madness, Tang fell in love with basketball.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Except, well, he wasn't very good. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It was a bible scholarship that got him to North Central College. He later attended junior college before dropping out, partly because of money, partly due to immaturity. (He would earn his degree from Charter Oak State College years later.)\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tang returned to Texas, intent on becoming a youth pastor. But when the founder of Heritage Christian Academy, Dr. Jennifer Cooper, was searching for a basketball coach, she turned to Mike Allard, Tang's own youth pastor at Green’s Bayou Assembly of God. He recommended this energetic kid with a devout faith in both Jesus and basketball. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We drove around in, like, a Cheech-and-Chong van to get places,” Tang says. “It was the best place in the world.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tang soon built the small school into a national power, pumping out prospects such as Von Wafer, who played at Florida State and in the NBA. And he was still there in 2002 when Drew was hired to clean up \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sports-college-football-nfl-business-mens-college-basketball-bd83e9e43e464016b6e29d6d9ec98818\">an inconceivable mess at Baylor.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>Drew needed someone with an unflinchingly positive attitude who could recruit in Texas, and over dinner one night, Tang won him over, earning a job that Drew had very nearly given to someone else.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Nearly two decades later, inside a quiet football stadium at the end of an NCAA Tournament played entirely inside a COVID-19 bubble, Drew and Tang celebrated the Bears \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/baylor-win-defeat-gonzaga-1st-ncaa-basketball-championship-1d53c12b04f50a9ea50110e787cc6567\">winning the 2021 national championship\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Scott allowed us to make mistakes,” says Tang, who has Drew's book, “The Road to Joy,” prominently displayed above his otherwise haphazard desk. “I mean, we were young, so we could make mistakes. And sometimes in this business, you're not allowed to make mistakes. I'll never be able to thank him for that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gene Taylor remembers a moment last year when the Wildcats still had just five players on their roster, and he was rightfully nervous. The athletic director had hired Tang after a pair of lengthy linterviews, one in Kansas City and one at Tang's home in Waco, Texas, and entrusted him with a program long on tradition but short on recent success.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I asked, ‘Are we OK?’” Taylor recalled, \"and he said, ‘Gene, we're fine. I don’t just want guys; I want the right guys.'”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The right guys turned out to be a motley crew carefully assembled during that hot summer in the Flint Hills.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nowell is the 5-foot-8 sparkplug that Kentucky coach John Calipari couldn't get himself to call by name — “That little guy,” coach Cal said — after he'd minced up his own Wildcats in last weekend's second-round tourney game. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Keyontae Johnson, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ap-all-america-mens-basketball-team-2ab037abcde5157ad840f7dcd22cc8a4\">voted an All-American alongside Nowell\u003c/a>, was playing for Florida when he collapsed on the court during a game in December 2020.

Desi Sills arrived from Arkansas State, Abayomi Iyiola from Hofstra. Nae'Qwan Tomlin, who never even played basketball in high school, signed out of junior college, and a pair of freshmen were sold on Tang's unwavering vision for the future.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Nobody,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said, “has done a better job of assembling talent in a short amount of time.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Picked to finish last in the Big 12, the Wildcats finished third. The reward was a No. 3 seed in March Madness, where the Wildcats \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/march-madness-kansas-state-montana-state-c73a1a3cad7f67d1db2b315deb5917eb\">knocked off Montana State\u003c/a> in the first round before toppling Kentucky last weekend.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Now, they're just two more wins away from their first Final Four in nearly 50 years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I like doing first stuff, you know?” Tang says, leaning forward in a purple wingback chair in the corner of his office, where boxes still remain unpacked a year after moving in. “Players, you ask them, do you remember your first dunk? They all remember their first dunk. Do you remember your third dunk? They don’t. Do you remember your first girlfriend? My first girlfriend was Pam Hubbard. My last was Careylyen, and I married her. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“You remember your firsts and your lasts,” Tang says, \"and I like firsts.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP March Madness coverage:

World Water Development Report 2023 painted a stark picture of the huge gap that needs to be filled to meet U.N. goals to ensure all people have access to clean water and sanitation by 2030.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Richard Connor, editor-in-chief of the report, told a news conference that the estimated cost of meeting the goals is somewhere between $600 billion and $1 trillion a year. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But equally important, Connor said, is forging partnerships with investors, financiers, governments and climate change communities to ensure that money is invested in ways to sustain the environment and provide potable water to the 2 billion people who don’t have it and sanitation to the 3.6 million in need.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>According to the report, water use has been increasing globally by roughly 1% per year over the last 40 years “and is expected to grow at a similar rate through to 2050, driven by a combination of population growth, socio-economic development and changing consumption patterns.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:610860613396' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='7a3671dc74f788e36adff9ef9879ed91'>Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) \u003c/div>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Connor said that actual increase in demand is happening in developing countries and emerging economies where it is driven by industrial growth and especially the rapid increase in the population of cities. It is in these urban areas “that you’re having a real big increase in demand,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With agriculture using 70% of all water globally, Connor said, irrigation for crops has to be more efficient — as it is in some countries that now use drip irrigation, which saves water. “That allows water to be available to cities,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As a result of climate change, the report said, “seasonal water scarcity will increase in regions where it is currently abundant — such as Central Africa, East Asia and parts of South America — and worsen in regions where water is already in short supply, such as the Middle East and the Sahara in Africa.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>On average, “10% of the global population lives in countries with high or critical water stress” — and up to 3.5 billion people live under conditions of water stress at least one month a year, said the report issued by UNESCO, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='2af7e37e6d51424b95abf24c08109958' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Since 2000, floods in the tropics have quadrupled while floods in the north mid-latitudes have increased 2.5-fold, the report said. Trends in droughts are more difficult to establish, it said, “although an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts and 'heat extremes’ can be expected in most regions as a direct result of climate change.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>As for water pollution, Connor said, the biggest source of pollution is untreated wastewater.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Globally, 80 percent of wastewater is released to the environment without any treatment,” he said, “and in many developing countries it’s pretty much 99%.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>These and other issues including protecting aquatic ecosystems, improving management of water resources, increasing water reuse and promoting cooperation across borders on water use will be discussed during the three-day U.N. Water Conference co-chaired by King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rahmon opening Wednesday morning.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There are 171 countries, including over 100 ministers, on the speakers list along with more than 20 organizations.

Of the 14 action sequences — yes, 14 — a few are truly mind-blowing, like a fight in the middle of the traffic circle around the Arc de Triomphe and a drone capturing a complicated set piece in a building involving what is being called a dragon’s breath shotgun.

My earliest and fondest memories of NBA basketball are of watching Willis, who embodied the winning spirit that defined the New York Knicks’ championship teams in the early 1970s,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. “He played the game with remarkable passion and determination, and his inspiring comeback in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals remains one of the most iconic moments in all of sports.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reed's accomplishments — seven All-Star selections, two NBA Finals MVP awards among them — would have warranted Hall of Fame induction by themselves. During the 1969-70 season, he became the first player to sweep the MVP awards for the regular season, All-Star Game and NBA Finals.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But his spot in history was secured simply by walking onto the floor on the final night of that season.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Reed had injured a thigh muscle in Game 5 of the series between the Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers, tumbling to the court in pain. He sat out Game 6 as counterpart Wilt Chamberlain had 45 points and 27 rebounds in a Lakers romp that forced a deciding game at Madison Square Garden.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reed’s status was unknown even to his Knicks teammates as he continued getting treatment until shortly before Game 7. Both teams were warming up when Reed came out of the tunnel, fans rising and roaring when they saw him emerge from the tunnel leading to the locker room.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“And here comes Willis and the crowd is going wild,” radio announcer Marv Albert said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Lakers stopped to watch Reed, who made two quick jump shots in the early minutes of the game, running back down the court after both with a noticeable limp. He wouldn’t score again but the Knicks didn’t need it, with their captain’s return and Walt Frazier’s 36 points and 19 assists energizing them to a 113-99 romp and their \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHzxM69qm50\">first NBA title\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Frazier’s performance was one of the finest ever in a deciding game, but it was forever a footnote to Reed’s return. In 2006, to coincide with the NBA’s 60th anniversary, it finished third in voting of the league’s 60 greatest playoff moments, behind Michael Jordan’s championship-winning jumper for his sixth title in 1998 and Magic Johnson ending his rookie season by filling in for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at center in Game 6 of the 1980 finals to lead the Lakers to a championship.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Long afterward, a player’s return from injury has sometimes compared to Reed, such as when Boston’s Paul Pierce was carried off the floor with a knee injury in Game 1 of the 2008 NBA Finals against Los Angeles before quickly returning. But Phil Jackson, a teammate of Reed’s and then Lakers coach, dismissed that because of how serious Reed’s injury was.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“If I’m not mistaken, I think Willis Reed missed a whole half and three-quarters almost of a game and literally had to have a shot — a horse shot, three or four of them — in his thigh to come back out and play,” Jackson said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reed wouldn’t be able to recover so quickly from injuries in the coming years. He was limited to just 11 games in 1971-72 but came back strong the next season to spark the Knicks to a second title in what was his last full season.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Though his return always made the ‘70 title the more celebrated one, it was the ’72-73 squad, having been fortified by Hall of Famers Earl Monroe and Jerry Lucas, that stood out to Reed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“That, to me, in my mind was the best team,” he said during its 40th anniversary celebration.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reed would play only 19 games in 1973-74 before retiring because of a knee injury after just 10 seasons.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That was long enough to collect more than 12,000 points and 8,400 rebounds, both of which still rank in the top three on the Knicks’ career lists.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>He had a successful post-playing career as a coach and executive, with 76ers coach Doc Rivers recalling playing for Atlanta when Reed was an assistant coach.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He was simply a great person, A man!!! A leader!!! A Winner!!!” \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/DocRivers/status/1638259502154674191?s=20\">Rivers tweeted\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Willis Reed was born June 25, 1942, in Hico, Louisiana. He stayed in his home state for his college career, leading Grambling State to the 1961 NAIA championship and a third-place finish in 1963. The school retired his number and named its court after Reed in 2022.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A second-round pick in 1964, he quickly proved that standing only 6-foot-9 wouldn’t keep him from becoming one of the league’s top centers. He was voted Rookie of the Year and earned the first of his seven straight All-Star selections.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reed was the anchor as the Knicks became one of the best teams in the NBA, with Hall of Famers such as Frazier, Bill Bradley and Dave DeBusschere.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reed provided them with 18.7 points and 12.9 rebounds for his career, along with plenty of toughness. An ESPN documentary in 2014 on those Knicks showed footage of a 1966 fight in a game against the Lakers in which Reed appeared to throw punches at multiple opponents, with Jackson noting that it appeared Reed “decimated this team.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>His No. 19 was the first number retired by the Knicks and he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame in 1982.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reed went on to coach the Knicks to a playoff berth in 1977-78 but coached them only 14 more games the following season. He also was a head coach at Creighton and the New Jersey Nets, but his greatest success after his playing career came in the front office.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He was their senior vice president of
